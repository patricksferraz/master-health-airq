# Master-ds

## code

### preprocessing-datasets.ipynb

For execution, it is necessary to use the PySUS tool made available through this [link](https://github.com/patricksferraz/PySUS).

### data-analysis.ipynb

#### Install

First, is necessary install all dependencies and activate enviroment

```shell
conda env create -n env-name -f code/master-ds.yml
conda activate env-name
```

Second, enable interactive tools for jupyter lab and execute

```shell
conda install -c conda-forge nodejs
jupyter labextension install @jupyter-widgets/jupyterlab-manager
jupyter-lab
```

### Utils

#### .env-example

example of .env to execute process_addr

#### description

#### process_addr.py

script for collecting addresses using zip code and grouping on a single datasource

##### Usage

1. Create .env file with session tokens, if you use webmania;
2. Create `.buffer` directory and add the **csv.gz** files you want to run;
3. The outputs will be stored in the `.process` directory and a single **RD.csv.gz** file will be generated in the root folder.
