abstract = "The carbonaceous aerosol accounts for an important part of total aerosol mass, affects human health and climate through its effects on physical and chemical properties of the aerosol, yet the understanding of its atmospheric sources and sinks is still incomplete. This study shows the state-of-the-art in modelling carbonaceous aerosol over Europe by comparing simulations performed with seven chemical transport models (CTMs) currently in air quality assessments in Europe: CAMx, CHIMERE, CMAQ, EMEP/MSC-W, LOTOS-EUROS, MINNI and RCGC. The simulations were carried out in the framework of the EURODELTA III modelling exercise and were evaluated against field measurements from intensive campaigns of European Monitoring and Evaluation Programme (EMEP) and the European Integrated Project on Aerosol Cloud Climate and Air Quality Interactions (EUCAARI). Model simulations were performed over the same domain, using as much as possible the same input data and covering four seasons: summer (1–30 June 2006), winter (8 January – 4 February 2007), autumn (17 September- 15 October 2008) and spring (25 February - 26 March 2009). The analyses of models’ performances in prediction of elemental carbon (EC) for the four seasons and organic aerosol components (OA) for the last two seasons show that all models generally underestimate the measured concentrations. The maximum underestimation of EC is about 60% and up to about 80% for total organic matter (TOM). The underestimation of TOM outside of highly polluted area is a consequence of an underestimation of secondary organic aerosol (SOA), in particular of its main contributor: biogenic secondary aerosol (BSOA). This result is independent on the SOA modelling approach used and season. The concentrations and daily cycles of total primary organic matter (TPOM) are generally better reproduced by the models since they used the same anthropogenic emissions. However, the combination of emissions and model formulation leads to overestimate TPOM concentrations in 2009 for most of the models. All models capture relatively well the SOA daily cycles at rural stations mainly due to the spatial resolution used in the simulations. For the investigated carbonaceous aerosol compounds, the differences between the concentrations simulated by different models are lower than the differences between the concentrations simulated with a model for different seasons."

They often result in cardiorespiratory diseases among urban dwellers and thus counteract important urban health targets. In cities, both stressors often occur simultaneously because their main source is urban traffic. Nevertheless, little is known about the combined exposure of acoustic noise and particle air pollution and their spatial distribution in urban residential areas. Filling this gap, landscape metrics were used to explain outdoor noise and PM10 patterns. Using Leipzig in central Germany as a case study, a highly statistical relationship exists between particle air pollution concentration and acoustic noise level that differs according to the urban structure type, as determined by landscape metrics. In conclusion, landscape metrics are very useful in predicting noise and PM10 exposure, together and in combination, for people in urban structures. Conversely, landscape metrics might serve as initial indicators of potential noise and air pollution in residential areas in cases in which no measured data are available, e.g., for planning purposes."

Socioeconomic and racial-ethnic inequalities in exposure to the three criteria pollutants were also investigated using multiple linear regression models. In addition, differences in inhalation doses from breathing the three +criteria pollutants were investigated for the top and bottom quartile racial composition in the parks and neighborhoods. Our research showed that although public parks had on average the lowest pollutant concentrations of NO2 and PM2.5, they had relatively high O3 concentrations. Park-adjacent neighborhoods, by contrast, had the highest NO2 and PM2.5 concentrations, but the lowest O3 concentrations. Higher exposures to NO2 and PM2.5 were systematically identified for the lower socioeconomic position or higher minority population neighborhoods. For children and adolescents aged 6–15 engaging in high and moderate intensity activities in and around public parks, those from the top quartile of primarily Hispanic neighborhoods had much higher (63%) inhaled doses of NO2 compared to the bottom quartile counterpart. PM2.5 showed a similar but less pronounced pattern of inhalation doses. Evidence of socioeconomic and racial-ethnic gradients was found in air pollution exposure and inhalation doses in and around the urban parks in Los Angeles. This suggests that patterns of exposure inequality found in other environmental justice research are present in exposures in and around urban parks."

abstract = "Background
Black carbon (BC) caused by incomplete combustion of fossil and bio-fuel has a dual effect on health and climate. There is a need for systematic approaches to evaluation of health outcomes and climate impacts relevant to BC exposure.
Objectives
We propose and illustrate for the first time, to our knowledge, an integrated analysis of a region-specific health model with climate change valuation module to quantify the health and climate consequences of BC exposure.
Methods
Based on the data from regional air pollution monitoring stations from 2013 to 2014 in the Pearl River Delta region (PRD), China, we analyzed the carcinogenic and non-carcinogenic effects and the relative risk of cause-specific mortality due to BC exposure in three typical cities of the PRD (i.e. Guangzhou, Jiangmen and Huizhou). The radiative forcing (RF) and heating rate (HR) were calculated by the Fu-Liou-Gu (FLG) plane-parallel radiation model and the conversion of empirical formula. We further connected the health and climate impacts by calculating the excess mortalities attributed to climate warming due to BC.
Results
Between 2013 and 2014, carcinogenic risks of adults and children due to BC exposure in the PRD were higher than the recommended limits (1 × 10−6 to 1 × 10−4), resulting in an excess of 4.82 cancer cases per 10,000 adults (4.82 × 10−4) and an excess of 1.97 cancer cases per 10,000 children (1.97 × 10−4). Non-carcinogenic risk caused by BC was not found. The relative risks of BC exposure on mortality were higher in winter and dry season. The atmospheric RFs of BC were 26.31 W m−2, 26.41 W m−2, and 22.45 W m−2 for Guangzhou, Jiangmen and Huizhou, leading to a warming of the atmosphere in the PRD. The estimated annual excess mortalities of climate warming due to BC were 5052 (95% CI: 1983, 8139), 5121 (95% CI: 2010, 8249) and 4363 (95% CI: 1712, 7032) for Guangzhou, Jiangmen and Huizhou, respectively.
Conclusion
Our estimates suggest that current levels of BC exposure in the PRD region posed a considerable risk to human health and the climate. Reduction of BC emission could lead to substantial health and climate co-benefits."

abstract = "Background
More than half of the world's population lives in urban environments. Due to urban related factors (e.g. higher air pollution), urban residents may face higher risk of adverse health outcomes, while access to green space could benefit health.
Purpose
We explored associations between urban and green land-use and birth weight.
Methods
Connecticut, U.S., birth certificate data (2000–2006) were acquired (n=239,811), and land-use data were obtained from the National Land Cover Database. We focused on three land-uses; urban space, urban open space, and green space (i.e. forest, shrub, herbaceous, and cultivated land). We estimated fractions of greenness and urbanicity within 250m from residence. A linear mixed effects model was conducted for birth weight and a logistic mixed effects model for low birth weight (LBW) and small for gestational age (SGA).
Results
An interquartile range (IQR) increment in the fraction of green space within 250m of residence was associated with 3.2g (95% Confidence Interval [0.4, 6.0]) higher birth weight. Similarly, an IQR increase in green space was associated with 7.6% [2.6, 12.4] decreased risk of LBW. Exposure to urban space was negatively correlated with green space (Pearson correlation=−0.88), and it showed negative association with birth outcomes. Results were generally robust with different buffer sizes and controlling for fine particles (PM2.5) and traffic.
Conclusions
We found protective associations by green space on birth outcomes. Increasing green space and/or reducing urban space (e.g. the greening of city environments) may reduce the risk of adverse birth outcomes such as LBW and SGA. Populations living in urban environments will grow in the next half century, and allocation of green space among urban areas may play a critical role for public health in urban planning."

The industry in the area led to a major economic development and rapid population growth in the second half of the twentieth century. The concerning registered pollutants are sulfur dioxide (SO2) and particles in the order of 10 micrometers or less (PM10). The prediction of concentrations of those pollutants can be a powerful tool in order to take preventive measures such as the reduction of emissions and alerting the affected population. This work presents a forecasting model to predict average concentration of PM10 for the next 24 hours. The proposed model uses a combination of Multilayer Perceptron Neural Network and clustering algorithm. The source database used contains historical time series of meteorological variables and concentrations of PM10 collected in three different stations in Salamanca. The clustering algorithms have been implemented in order to find relationships between PM10 and meteorological variables. These relationships will help us to get additional information that will be used in the prediction model. The proposed model was compared, for accuracy and validation purposes, with a simple Multilayer Perceptron and a multiple Linear Regression. The performance estimation is determined using the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and the Mean Absolute Error (MAE). The obtained results show the importance of this set of meteorological variables in the prediction of pollutant concentrations."

Two cases were considered for the period April–September 2003: (1) actual land use and (2) a fictitious scenario where El Pardo peri-urban forest was converted to bare-soil.

The activity sectors influencing most the PM2.5 levels in the study area are energy production (22%), agriculture (19%), residential combustion (16%) and road transport (7%). The energy production in inefficient coal-fuelled power plants was identified as one of main source of PM2.5 in the Western Balkans. As for the geographical origin of PM2.5, the transboundary pollution is confirmed as the main origin of PM2.5 (44%) in the investigated cities, while the city own emissions and the national sources outside the concerned city impact on average 22% and 15%, respectively. An association was observed between the long-range transport and the impact of agriculture and energy production, while both local urban emissions and long-range transport were associated with the residential sector. A special attention is given in this study to biomass, a renewable source, which use is often promoted in the frame of climate and energy policies. Nevertheless, the combustion of biomass in inefficient small appliances has considerable particulate matter emissions and therefore this type of practice impacts negatively on air quality. Considering that biomass is traditionally used in South-East Europe as fuel for residential heating, the interpretation of the model results was supported with the estimation of biomass burning contributions to PM2.5 obtained with receptor models and data on biomass fuel consumption from the literature. The analysis of the contributions from biomass burning derived from receptor models suggests that biomass burning is the dominant source within the residential heating sector in the studied area and that the emissions from this source are likely underestimated. This study concludes that more effort is needed to improve the estimations of biomass burning emissions and that policies to improve air quality in the cities should involve a geographic context wider than the city level."

The model was developed from 13 different air pollution monitoring stations in Beijing, Tianjin, and Hebei province (Jing-Jin-Ji area). The air mass trajectory was used to recognize distinct corridors for transport of “dirty” air and “clean” air to selected stations. With each corridor, a triangular station net was constructed based on air mass trajectories and the distances between neighboring sites. Wind speed and direction were also considered as parameters in calculating this trajectory based air pollution indicator value. Moreover, the original time series of PM2.5 concentration was decomposed by wavelet transformation into a few sub-series with lower variability. The prediction strategy applied to each of them and then summed up the individual prediction results. Daily meteorological forecast variables as well as the respective pollutant predictors were used as input to a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) type of back-propagation neural network. The experimental verification of the proposed model was conducted over a period of more than one year (between September 2013 and October 2014). It is found that the trajectory based geographic model and wavelet transformation can be effective tools to improve the PM2.5 forecasting accuracy. The root mean squared error (RMSE) of the hybrid model can be reduced, on the average, by up to 40 percent. Particularly, the high PM2.5 days are almost anticipated by using wavelet decomposition and the detection rate (DR) for a given alert threshold of hybrid model can reach 90% on average. This approach shows the potential to be applied in other countries’ air quality forecasting systems."

Both the wind observations and the model simulations have clearly indicated the evolution of the sea-land and mountain-valley breeze circulations during the event. The WRF-CHEM model generally reproduces the local meteorological circulations and also performs well in simulating temporal variations and spatial distributions of fine particulate matters (PM2.5) and ozone (O3) concentrations compared to observations in BTH. The model results have shown that the offshore land breeze transports the pollutants formed in Shandong province to the Bohai Gulf in the morning, causing the formation of high O3 and PM2.5 concentrations over the gulf. The onshore sea breeze not only causes the formation of a convergence zone to induce upward movement, mitigating the surface pollution to some degree, also recirculates the pollutants over the gulf to deteriorate the air quality in the coastal area. The upward valley breeze brings the pollutants in the urban area of Beijing to the mountain area in the afternoon, and the downward mountain breeze transports the pollutants back during nighttime. The intensity of the mountain-valley breeze circulation is weak compared to the land-sea breeze circulation in BTH. It is worth noting that the local circulations play an important role when the large-scale meteorological conditions are relatively weak."

We examined the trends in rural and urban areas to get a better insight about the trends of regional and local source emissions. Decreases in PM2.5 concentrations (µg/m3) were more pronounced in urban areas than in rural ones. In addition, the highest and lowest PM2.5 decreases (µg/m3) were observed for winter and summer, respectively. Together, these findings suggest that primary particle concentrations decreased more relative to secondary ones. This is also supported by the analysis of the speciation data which showed that downward trends of primary pollutants including black carbon were stronger than those of secondary pollutants including sulfate. Furthermore, this study found that ambient primary pollutants decreased at the same rate as their respective source emissions. This was not the case for secondary pollutants which decreased at a slower rate than that of their precursor emissions. This indicates that concentrations of secondary pollutants depend not only on the primary emissions but also on the availability of atmospheric oxidants which might not change during the study period. This novel approach of investigating spatially varying concentration trends, in combination with ground PM2.5 species trends, can be of substantial regulatory importance."

Among different air pollutants, PM2.5 is considered as the major air pollutant in urbanized regions, especially because of serious harmful health effects on human being. So, there is an urgent need to develop air quality forecast programs capable of providing accurate predictions over a long future horizon. Predicting PM2.5 concentrations for several steps ahead of time is of great interest, especially in decision-making related to control policies and emergency measures such as traffic limitations, school closures, or temporarily shutting down major polluting industrial units. In this paper, commonly used multi-step ahead prediction strategies, including Recursive (Rec), Direct (Dir), Direct-Recursive (DirRec), Multi-Input Multi-Output (MIMO) and Direct-MIMO (DIRMO) along with Autoregressive integrated moving average with exogenous variables (ARIMAX) and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) modelling techniques are examined. Also, the independent variables are considered as time series variables and are forecasted using ARIMA/MLP model in order to be used for prediction of the dependent variables in multi-steps ahead of time. The experimental study is performed using PM2.5 data in Mashhad, Iran. Daily PM2.5 forecasts for this city is provided for the next 10 days. Four different feature selection methods are also implemented and compared. The results indicate that recursive strategy with LASSO feature selection in ARIMAX model overcomes in most of time steps."

abstract = "Exploring the spatial distribution of air pollutants under future urban planning scenarios is essential as urban sprawl increases in China. However, existing published prediction models usually forecast pollutant concentrations at the station level or estimate spatial distribution of pollutant in a historical perspective. This study has developed a hybrid Grey-Markov/land use regression (LUR) model (GMLUR) for PM10 concentration prediction under future urban scenarios by employing the forecast of Grey-Markov model as surrogate measurements to calibrate the spatial estimations of LUR model. Taking the agglomeration of Changsha-Zhuzhou-Xiangtan (CZT) in China as a case, the superiority of GMLUR was tested and spatial distribution of PM10 concentrations based on four potential land use scenarios for the year 2020 were predicted. Results show that GMLUR modelling outperforms LUR modelling with clear lower average relative percentage error (5.13% vs. 24.09%) and root-mean-square error (5.50 μg/m3 vs. 21.31 μg/m3). The economic interest scenario identifies the largest demands of future built-up (2 306.50 km2) and bare (34.88 km2) areas. Built-up area demands for the business as usual scenario, resource-conserving scenario, and ecological interest scenario are 362.67, 1 042.22, and 1 014.70 km2, respectively. Correspondingly, the economic interest scenario identifies the severest PM10 pollution with the highest mean predicted concentration of 53.78 μg/m3 and the largest percent (19.43%) of area exceeding the Level 2 value (70 μg/m3) of Chinese National Ambient Air Quality Standard (CNAAQS); these are significantly higher than those of the business as usual scenario (49.63 μg/m3, 6.28%). The resource-conserving scenario (46.79 μg/m3) and ecological interest scenario (46.76 μg/m3) are cleaner with no area exceeding the Level 2 value of CNAAQS. It can be concluded that GMLUR modelling provides a feasible way to evaluate the potential outcome of future urban planning strategies in the perspective of air pollution."

This is the case in the Brazilian Amazon rainforest region where forest fires are frequent sources of high pollution. In this study, we applied a non-linear model for predicting PM2.5 concentration from AOD retrievals using interaction terms between average temperature, relative humidity, sine, cosine of date in a period of 365,25 days and the square of the lagged relative residual. Regression performance statistics were tested comparing the goodness of fit and R2 based on results from linear regression and non-linear regression for six different models. The regression results for non-linear prediction showed the best performance, explaining on average 82% of the daily PM2.5 concentrations when considering the whole period studied. In the context of Amazonia, it was the first study predicting PM2.5 concentrations using the latest high-resolution AOD products also in combination with the testing of a non-linear model performance. Our results permitted a reliable prediction considering the AOD-PM2.5 relationship and set the basis for further investigations on air pollution impacts in the complex context of Brazilian Amazon Region."

The concentrations of CO, NOx, SO2 and PM at sensitive receptor locations were used as indicators in comparison to World Health Organization (WHO) interim guidelines. Exceedance exposure areas were delineated under bounded uncertainties in input emission factors and meteorological parameters. Planning and management initiatives were tested to control/minimize potential exposure. Compared to the case of low emissions and actual meteorological conditions, the consideration of worst emissions coupled to worst meteorological conditions enlarged the boundaries of the exceedance exposure areas considerably. The implementation of best available technologies and enforcement of emission standards improved air quality in the region significantly and lowered the exposure at many population centers to below health standards. Uncertainty in the output of atmospheric dispersion models continues to play a significant role to be considered at the point where science is translated into political decision making."

The LIFE MED HISS project aims at setting up a surveillance system on the long term effects of air pollution on health, using data from National Health Interview Surveys and other currently available sources of information in most European countries. Few studies assessed the long term effect of air pollution on hospital admissions in European cohorts.
Objective
The objective of this paper is to estimate the long term effect of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) on first-ever (incident) cause-specific hospitalizations in Italy.
Methods
We used data from the Italian Longitudinal Study (ILS), a cohort study based on the 1999–2000 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS), followed up for hospitalization (2001–2008) at individual level. The survey contains information on crucial potential confounders: occupational/educational/marital status, body mass index (BMI), smoking habit and physical activity. Annual mean exposure to PM2.5 and NO2 was assigned starting from simulated gridded data at spatial resolution of 4 × 4 km2 firstly integrated with data from monitoring stations and then up-scaled at municipality level. Statistical analyses were conducted using Cox proportional hazard models with robust variance estimator.
Results
For each cause of hospitalization we estimated the hazard ratios (HRs) adjusted for confounders with 95% Confidence Interval (CI) related to a 10 μg/m3 increase in pollutants. For PM2.5 and NO2, respectively, we found positive associations for circulatory system diseases [1.05(1.03–1.06); 1.05(1.03–1.07)], myocardial infarction [1.15(1.12–1.18); 1.15(1.12–1.18)], lung cancer [1.18(1.10–1.26); 1.20(1.12–1.28)], kidney cancer [1.24(1.11–1.29); 1.20(1.07–1.33)], all cancers (but lung) [1.06(1.04–1.08); 1.06(1.04–1.08)] and Low Respiratory Tract Infections (LRTI) [1.07 (1.04–1.11); 1.05 (1.02–1.08)].
Discussion
Our results add new evidence on the effects of air pollution on first-ever (incident) hospitalizations, both in urban and rural areas. We demonstrated the feasibility of a low-cost monitoring system based on available data."

Aiming to inform the population about the air they are breathing, several air quality modelling systems have been developed and tested allowing the assessment and forecast of air pollution ambient levels in many countries. However, every day, an individual is exposed to different concentrations of atmospheric pollutants as he/she moves from and to different outdoor and indoor places (the so-called microenvironments). Therefore, a more efficient way to prevent the population from the health risks caused by air pollution should be based on exposure rather than air concentrations estimations. The objective of the present study is to develop a methodology to forecast the human exposure of the Portuguese population based on the air quality forecasting system available and validated for Portugal since 2005. Besides that, a long-term evaluation of human exposure estimates aims to be obtained using one-year of this forecasting system application. Additionally, a hypothetical 50% emission reduction scenario has been designed and studied as a contribution to study emission reduction strategies impact on human exposure. To estimate the population exposure the forecasting results of the air quality modelling system MM5-CHIMERE have been combined with the population spatial distribution over Portugal and their time-activity patterns, i.e. the fraction of the day time spent in specific indoor and outdoor places. The population characterization concerning age, work, type of occupation and related time spent was obtained from national census and available enquiries performed by the National Institute of Statistics. A daily exposure estimation module has been developed gathering all these data and considering empirical indoor/outdoor relations from literature to calculate the indoor concentrations in each one of the microenvironments considered, namely home, office/school, and other indoors (leisure activities like shopping areas, gym, theatre/cinema and restaurants). The results show how this developed modelling system can be useful to anticipate air pollution episodes and to estimate their effects on human health on a long-term basis. The two metropolitan areas of Porto and Lisbon are identified as the most critical ones in terms of air pollution effects on human health over Portugal in a long-term as well as in a short-term perspective. The coexistence of high concentration values and high population density is the key factor for these stressed areas. Regarding the 50% emission reduction scenario, the model results are significantly different for both pollutants: there is a small overall reduction in the individual exposure values of PM10 (<10 μg m−3 h), but for O3, in contrast, there is an extended area where exposure values increase with emission reduction. This detailed knowledge is a prerequisite for the development of effective policies to reduce the foreseen adverse impact of air pollution on human health and to act on time."

The results from the estimation of the enrichment factors (EF) showed that Pb is the heavy metal with the highest values, followed by the Zn, Cu and Cr. The EF obtained for all heavy metals show that there is a moderate to high anthropogenic enrichment. The above indicates that in the MZTV there are emission sources that contribute (significantly) in the amount of Cr, Cu, Pb and Zn accumulated in the biomonitor. Combustion processes, vehicle emissions, biomass burning, brick kiln emissions, agricultural and livestock activities, manufacturing industry and re-deposition by the action of the wind, were identified as the main heavy metals sources in the MZTV. Risk maps showed the high and medium risk areas are located in sites with poor urban vegetation coverage and close to highways and industrial parks. Low risk areas are located in sites with high urban vegetation coverage. The method used for identifying risk areas is a rapid and low-cost evaluation tool can allow local government environmental agencies to define public policies on air pollution control."

It is an important problem for public health research to accurately estimate the spatial distribution of high PM concentrations from a limited number of monitoring stations. In this study, a maximum entropy (MaxEnt) model was adopted to obtain the probability distribution map of high PM10 concentrations. Daily PM10 concentration data from 19 air quality monitoring stations from the years 2008–2011 were collected. Land cover, road density, and meteorological data were selected as explanatory variables entered in the model. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was used to evaluate the performance of the MaxEnt model. The area under the ROC curve (AUC) shows that the MaxEnt model fits well in the four year period. AUC is 0.78 in 2008, 0.79 in 2009, 0.81 in 2010, and 0.80 in 2011. A probability distribution map of high PM10 concentration indicates high human health risks in regions of Beijing in areas with dense roads and buildings. During the entire research period from 2008 to 2011, the distribution of high PM10 concentration is relatively stable and it indicates that the trend of high concentration has not changed significantly during the four years. Traffic and land cover are the two most important factors that can explain more than 80% variance of PM10 from 2008 to 2011."

In this study, integrated Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA) and Principle Component Regression (PCR) were adopted to assess the severity of air pollution impacts on mortality related to circulatory, respiratory and skin diseases in 25 districts of Seoul, South Korea for the years 2005–2015. These methods were consistent in determining the best regression models and most important pollutants related to mortality in those highly susceptible to poor air quality. Specifically, the results demonstrated that pneumonia was highly associated with air pollution, with a large determination coefficient (BMA: 0.46, PCR: 0.51) and high model's posterior probability (0.47). The most reliable prediction model for pneumonia was indicated by the lowest Bayesian Information Criterion. Among the pollutants, particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter of 10 μm or less (PM10) was associated with serious health risks on evaluation, with the highest posterior inclusion probabilities (range, 80.20 to 100.00%) and significantly positive correlation coefficients (range, 0.14 to 0.34, p < 0.05). In addition, excessive PM10 concentration (approximately 2.54 times the threshold) and a continuous increase in mortality due to respiratory diseases (approximately 1.50-fold in 10 years) were also exhibited. Overall, the results of this study suggest that currently, socio-environmental policies and international collaboration to mitigate health effects of air pollution is necessary in Seoul, Korea. Moreover, consideration of uncertainty of the regression model, which was verified in this research, will facilitate further application of this approach and enable optimal prediction of interactions between human and environmental factors."

These papers have mostly focused on commonly monitored air pollutants, primarily ozone (O3), particulate matter (PM), sulfur dioxide (SO2), carbon monoxide (CO), and nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and various indices of perinatal health, including fetal growth, pregnancy duration, and infant mortality. While most published studies have found some marker of air pollution related to some types of perinatal outcomes, variability exists in the nature of the pollutants and outcomes associated. Synthesis of the findings has been difficult for various reasons, including differences in study design and analysis. A workshop was held in September 2007 to discuss methodological differences in the published studies as a basis for understanding differences in study findings and to identify priorities for future research, including novel approaches for existing data. Four broad topic areas were considered: confounding and effect modification, spatial and temporal exposure variations, vulnerable windows of exposure, and multiple pollutants. Here we present a synopsis of the methodological issues and challenges in each area and make recommendations for future study. Two key recommendations include: (1) parallel analyses of existing data sets using a standardized methodological approach to disentangle true differences in associations from methodological differences among studies; and (2) identification of animal studies to inform important mechanistic research gaps. This work is of critical public health importance because of widespread exposure and because perinatal outcomes are important markers of future child and adult health."

Such time series were developed by adjusting ambient PM2.5 over an area according to a prescribed spatial pattern. A new technique for this purpose based on photochemical grid modeling for the continental U.S. is demonstrated here. The method uses a spatial prediction model to impute missing data and PM2.5 relative response factors based on simulations with reductions in anthropogenic emissions of primary PM2.5 and PM2.5 precursors (i.e., NOx and SO2). Case study results indicate that relatively urban sites are generally more responsive to primary PM2.5 reductions, while outlying sites are more responsive to NOx and SO2 reductions. The method enables the sensitivity of outcomes to be examined by quickly implementing PM2.5 adjustments based on different combinations of primary PM2.5 and NOx and SO2 emission reductions for areas of the U.S."

Passive ventilation has recently become widespread owing to its ability to reduce energy demand in buildings, such as the case of natural or cross ventilation. To understand the effect of natural ventilation on indoor environmental quality, outdoor–indoor flow paths need to be analyzed as functions of urban atmospheric conditions, topology of the built environment, and indoor conditions. Wind-driven natural ventilation (e.g., cross ventilation) can be calculated through the wind pressure coefficient distributions of outdoor wall surfaces and openings of a building, allowing the study of indoor air parameters and airborne contaminant concentrations. Variations in outside parameters will directly impact indoor air quality and residents’ health. Numerical modeling can contribute to comprehend these various parameters because it allows full control of boundary conditions and sampling points. In this study, numerical weather prediction modeling was used to calculate wind profiles/distributions at the atmospheric scale, and computational fluid dynamics was used to model detailed urban and indoor flows, which were then integrated into a dynamic downscaling analysis to predict specific urban wind parameters from the atmospheric to built-environment scale. Wind velocity and contaminant concentration distributions inside a factory building were analyzed to assess the quality of the human working environment by using a computer simulated person. The impact of cross ventilation flows and its variations on local average contaminant concentration around a factory worker, and inhaled contaminant dose, were then discussed."

To fulfill the need to identify the contribution of pollutants emitted by on-road vehicles and examine the limitations of various air quality models (boundary conditions, wind behavior representations, chemical mechanisms and reactions), a systematic review of the main traffic variables used in emissions and air quality modeling was performed. The discussion of their relationships, connections, and relevance showed a consistent sequence to generate traffic data using different traffic models. A list of key traffic variables to use as input data for vehicle emissions modeling and consequently to improve the accuracy of air quality modeling was proposed. A revision over 125 published articles was realized approaching methods to integrate traffic, emissions, air quality models, and detailing how these data can improve the results generated by the air quality model. Traffic models (macroscopic, mesoscopic, and microscopic) require variables at different levels of detail, such as traffic flow, speed, fuel consumption, and fleet composition. The emissions models (static and dynamic) are the key inputs to regional air quality models, but there is a tradeoff between the accuracy in emission estimates and the level of detail in model inputs. Meteorological data also influence the results. The conclusions showed that gaps remain on consistent emissions factors, spatial and temporal distributions, allocations of emissions on grid cells, and performance of the meteorological models. The average link-based traffic parameters are a persistent limitation. The proposed key traffic variables list point to flow per vehicle type as the most important variable. There is a need for scientific efforts to integrate traffic engineering data into emissions models to improve air quality modeling results using better traffic flow representations. Uncertainties in traffic data must first be analyzed, and accordingly a guidance with an accuracy reference for distinctive applications in different regions should be proposed."

The fraction of aromatic organic vapours in the exhaust from a marine engine, operating on HFO and MGO, was investigated by resonance-enhanced multi-photon ionisation time-of-flight mass spectrometry (REMPI-TOFMS). MGO with fuel sulphur content (FSC) below 0.1% and HFO with an average FSC of 2.7% denote representative marine fuels inside and outside SECAs, respectively. The obtained emission spectra were combined with data of previous REMPI-TOFMS studies of combustion engines and wood combustion in statistical analyses to derive marker substances for ship emissions inside and outside SECAs. A diagnostic ratio of C2-naphthalenes to methyl-naphthalenes was found to hold for a good discriminator between ship emissions on the one hand and road traffic and wood combustion on the other hand. Furthermore, random REMPI spectra from all emission sources were mixed with different proportions in a simulation to create a model based on partial least square (PLS) regression for the prediction of ship contribution to aromatic organic vapours. We point out that in particular PAHs with higher degree of alkylation are significant markers for primary ship emissions which may support source apportionment studies inside and outside SECAs to assess the benefits of fuel sulphur content regulation on air quality."

Over-threshold event forecasting is of paramount importance in the monitoring of environmental variables, such as those related to air pollution. This paper explores the use of nonlinear polynomial NARX models for the prediction of ozone concentration data, using specific cost functions and identification algorithms devised to enhance the prediction accuracy at the peak values of the signal, in order to improve the over-threshold event detection. Some preliminary results of the experimental data analysis carried out on observed time histories are illustrated to show the effectiveness of the presented methodology."

abstract = "Because of the lack of ground-based observations in large parts of West Asia, Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) is mainly monitored by using remote sensing techniques. AOD can also be predicted by short term forecasts with commonly called Deterministic weather prediction models (DMs). The skill of DMs in reproducing remotely sensed observations when averaged over monthly time scales over West Asia is rather limited due to significant uncertainties in inputs and complexity of dust, which is the dominant type of aerosols in the region. Machine Learning Algorithms (MLAs), which require much less computational expenses than DMs, can be used. Using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Deep Blue (DB) AOD as the representative of response variable, MLAs, especially Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS) and Support Vector Machines (SVM), outperformed DMs on monthly time scale. MLAs have yielded lower prediction error (RMSE) and higher correlation with observations than DMs. In addition, findings disclosed that DMs, especially MACC, have failed to simulate observed AOD values over western Iran where the Zagros Mountains prevent advection of fine dust particles to the east of the study area. Prediction errors of MLAs and DMs along with major DB AOD peaks, over Iraq, can be traced back to the rough resolution of variable datasets, omission of some unknown influential predictors representing the life cycle of dust and/or other aerosols, and scarcity of extreme cases. It also remains to be tested in how far the results presented can be generalized to other regions and time scales."

Results showed shipping emissions of particulate matter (PM) and NOx comparable to road traffic emissions at all port-cities, with larger contributions to local SO2 emissions. Contributions to PM2.5 ranged between 0.5% (Rijeka) and 7.4% (Brindisi), those to PM10 were between 0.3% (Rijeka) and 5.8% (Brindisi). Contributions to particle number concentration (PNC) showed an impact 2–4 times larger with respect to that on mass concentrations. Shipping impact on gaseous pollutants are larger than those to PM. The contribution to total polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAHs) concentrations was 82% in Venice and 56% in Brindisi, with a different partition gas-particle because of different meteorological conditions. The inter-annual trends analysis showed the primary contribution to PM concentrations decreasing, due to the implementation of the European legislation on the use of low-sulphur content fuels. This effect was not present on other pollutants like PAHs."

abstract = "The “Provence Alpes Côte d’Azur” (PACA) region, in the South East of France, is one of Europe’s regions most influenced by the atmospheric pollution. During the last 15 years, the industrial emissions decrease caused an evolution of the atmospheric pollution nature. Nowadays, atmospheric pollution is more and more influenced by the road traffic, the dominating pollution source in urban zones for the PACA region. Combined with this intense road traffic, the strong hot season of the Mediterranean climate contributes to the region bad air quality; it is known to be one of the worse in Europe. The recognized air pollution effects over public health include increased risk of hospital admissions and mortality by respiratory or cardiovascular diseases. The combination of these serious pollution related health hazards with senior and children vulnerabilities leads to serious sanitary concerns. Over the 1990–2005 period, we obtained, using the non-parametric Mann–Kendall test from annual mortality dataset (CépiDC), decreasing trends for Asthma (−5.00%year−1), Cardiovascular (−0.73%year−1), Ischemic (−0.69%year−1) and cerebrovascular diseases (−3.10%year−1). However, for “Other heart diseases” (+0.10%year−1) and “Respiratory” (+0.10%year−1) an increase was observed. The development of an adequate tool to understand impacts of pollution levels is of utmost importance. Different pollutants have different health endpoints, information may be lost through the use of a single index consequently, in this study we present the modified formula of air quality index, based on Cairncross’s concept the Aggregate Risk Index (ARI). ARI is based on the relative risk of the well-established increased daily mortality, or morbidity, enabling an assessment of additive effects of short-term exposure to the main air pollutants: PM2.5, PM10, SO2, O3 and NO2 in order to account for the reality of the multiple exposures impacts of chemical agents. The ARI, developed per pathology, takes into account the possible adverse effects associated with the coexistence of all pollutants. This index will enable to communicate the health risks associated, from modelled or monitored pollutant concentrations, to the general population. The second step will consist in the construction of a prediction model of this sanitary index."

Crowded cities are centres of creativity and economic progress, but polluted air, flooding and other climate impacts, means they also face major weather, climate and environment-related challenges. Increasingly dense, complex and interdependent urban systems leave cities vulnerable: a single extreme event can lead to a widespread breakdown of a city's infrastructure often through domino effects. The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) recognizes that rapid urbanization necessitates new types of services which make the best use of science and technology and considers the challenge of delivering these as one of the main priorities for the meteorological community. Such Integrated Urban Weather, Environment and Climate Services should assist cities in facing hazards such as storm surges, flooding, heat waves, and air pollution episodes, especially in changing climates. The aim is to build urban services that meet the special needs of cities through a combination of dense observation networks, high-resolution forecasts, multi-hazard early warning systems, and climate services for reducing emissions, that will enable the building of resilient, thriving sustainable cities that promote the Sustainable Development Goals. A number of recent international studies have been initiated to explore these issues. The paper provides a brief overview of recent WMO and collaborators research programs and activities in urban hydrometeorology, climate and air pollution; describes the novel concept of urban integrated weather, climate and environment related services; and highlights research needs for their realisation."

Additionally, levels of ambient air pollution in a city can be variable at the local scale and can create disparities in air quality between neighbourhoods. Socioeconomic and physical characteristics of neighbourhood environments can affect the health and well-being of local residents. In this paper we identify whether neighbourhoods in Montreal, Canada characterised by social and material deprivation have higher levels of ambient air pollution than do others. We collected two-week integrated samples of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) at 133 sites in Montreal during three seasons between 2005 and 2006. We used these data in a geographic information system, along with data describing characteristics of land use, roads, and traffic, to create a spatial model of predicted mean annual concentrations of NO2 across Montreal. Next, we collected neighbourhood socioeconomic information for 501 census tracts and overlaid their boundaries on the pollution surface. We calculated Pearson correlation coefficients and 95% confidence intervals (CI) between neighbourhood-level indicators of deprivation and levels of ambient NO2. We found associations between concentrations of NO2 and neighbourhood-level indicators of material deprivation, including median household income, and with indicators of social deprivation, including proportion of people living alone. We identified specific neighbourhoods that were characterised by a double burden of high levels of deprivation and high concentrations of ambient NO2. Because of the particular social geography in Montreal, we found that not all deprived neighbourhoods had high levels of pollution and that some affluent neighbourhoods in the downtown core had high levels. Our results underscore the importance of considering social contexts in interpreting general associations between social and environmental risks to population health."

In recent years, due to scientific and technological advancements, vertical VOC profile in the atmosphere has been increasingly studied since it plays an essential role in the atmospheric research by providing multilevel three-dimensional data. Such information will improve the predictive ability of existing air quality models. This review summarizes the latest development of vertical VOC sampling technologies, highlighting the technical and non-technical challenges with possible solutions and future applications of vertical VOC sampling technologies. Further, other important issues concerning ambient VOCs have also been discussed, e.g. emission sources, VOC air samplers, VOC monitoring strategies, factors influencing airborne VOC measurement, the use of VOC data in air quality models and future smart city air quality management. Since ambient VOC levels can fluctuate significantly with altitude, technologies for vertical VOC profiling have been developed from building/tower-based measurements and tethered balloons to aircrafts, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and satellites in order to improve the temporal-spatial capacity and accuracy. Between the existing sampling methods, so far, UAVs are capable of providing more reliable VOC measurements and better temporal-spatial capacities. Heretofore, their disadvantages and challenges, e.g. sampling height, sampling time, sensitivity of the sensors and interferences from other chemical species, have limited the application of UAV for vertical VOC profiling."

Simulation results are compared with continuous measurements of water flow and total suspended solids (TSS) at the catchment outlet. The performance of water flow and TSS simulations are satisfying with the calibrated parameters; however, no significant difference can be noticed at the catchment outlet between the two scenarios due to the “first flush” effects. Considering the Cu, BaP and BbF contents of different particle size classes, simulated event mean concentration of each pollutant is compared with local in-situ measurements. Finally, perspectives to improve model performance and experimental techniques are discussed."

The people occupancy schedule in different functional rooms was obtained by observing the change in CO2 concentration. A robust model for the estimation of formaldehyde emission rates using CO2 as the tracer gas; associated with a Monte-Carlo simulation of occupant activities and the characteristics of residences; has been developed. It is revealed that the mean indoor formaldehyde concentration was 30.12 μg/m3, which was slightly higher than the outdoor concentration of 27.80 μg/m3. The emission rates of 61.82 ± 52.39 and 49.69 ± 42.13μg/h/m2 (mean ± SD) during the daytime and nighttime, respectively with a daily average of 57.20 ± 48.79μg/h/m2.

We estimated adult premature mortalities due to PM2.5 across China in 2013 and mortality benefits for scenarios in which China meets the World Health Organization (WHO) Air Quality Guidelines (AQG) and three interim targets (ITs) for PM2.5. Attributable adult mortalities were estimated with assimilated spatial PM2.5 concentrations across China based on direct PM2.5 measurements from 506 PM2.5 monitoring sites and a regional air quality model, and using the integrated exposure-response model. Our results show that in China, 83% of the population lived in areas where PM2.5 concentrations exceeded the Chinese Ambient Air Quality Standard of 35μgm−3. Premature mortalities attributed to PM2.5 nationwide were 1.37 million in total, and 0.69, 0.38, 0.13, and 0.17 million for stroke, ischemic heart disease, lung cancer, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, respectively. High population density areas exhibited the highest health risks attributed to air pollution. The mortality benefits will be 23%, 39%, 66%, and 83% of the total present premature mortalities (1.37 million mortalities) when PM2.5 concentrations in China meet the WHO IT-1, IT-2, IT-3, and AQG, respectively. Our study shows that integrating PM2.5 concentrations based on the national monitoring network with the regional air quality model provides an advanced exposure estimate method with potentials to further improve the accuracy for mortality estimate; much higher health benefits could be achieved if China adopted more stringent WHO guidelines for PM2.5."

abstract = "Background and aims
In most developed countries, air pollution is monitored by stationary networks of air quality monitoring stations (AQMS). Due to high installation and maintenance costs, the number of such stations (especially those measuring particulate matter (PM) is often insufficient, placing limitations on the geographic coverage of air pollution monitoring and the accuracy of exposure assessment studies based on AQMS data. Semi-volatile organic compounds (sVOCs) often spread with PM and contribute to the PM composition when emitted into the atmosphere. As a result, sVOC concentrations in soil can help, as we hypothesize, to estimate average levels of PM air pollution in geographic areas in which PM monitoring by AQMS is sparse or unavailable.
Methods
Soil samples taken around the Ashkelon-South industrial area in Israel were tested for the presence of sVOCs compounds using a standard EPA 8270C protocol. PM pollution data obtained from local AQMSs were then mutually compared with sVOC soil contamination levels observed in the same locations, using spatial interpolation methods and multivariate statistical analysis tools.
Results
PM levels in the atmosphere, estimated using sVOC soil concentrations, and adjusted for several locational attributes and average levels of other commonly monitored air pollutants, revealed a reasonably strong association with PM2.5 averages actually recorded by AQMS, helping to explain 86–88% of the observed PM variation (R2-Adj. = 0.859–0.879), depending on the model type.
Conclusions
The study confirms feasibility of obtaining reasonably accurate PM air pollution estimates using sVOC soil testing. While the costs of establishment and maintenance of a dense network of AQMS may be prohibitive, the proposed approach may help to obtain reasonably accurate PM air pollution estimates for geographic areas in which PM monitoring by AQMS is sparse or unavailable."

There appeared to have been little influence on the episodic peak from changes in intercontinental trans-Atlantic transport but an overwhelming influence on the annual mean daily maximum levels. Non-linear relationships between VOC and NOx emission controls and ozone, together with the ambition level set by policy-makers, appear to explain why ozone levels in Central England still do not meet internationally accepted air quality guidelines despite two decades of policy actions within Europe."

In this study, a new and free–of–charge methodology for the densifying of the PM10 monitoring network of Berlin is presented. It endeavors to find the non–linear relationship between the hourly PM10 concentration of the still–operating PM10 monitoring stations and the shut–down stations by using the Artificial Neural Network (ANN), and, consequently, the results of the shut–down stations were simulated and re–constructed. However, input–variables selection is a pre–requisite for any ANN simulation, and hence a new fuzzy–heuristic input selection has been developed and joined to the ANN for the simulation. The hourly PM10 concentrations of the 20 shut–down stations were simulated and re–constructed. The mean error, bias and absolute error of the simulations were 27.7%, –0.03 (μg/m3), and 7.4 (μg/m3), respectively. Then, the simulated hourly PM10 concentration data were converted to a daily scale and the performance of ANN models which were developed for the simulation of the daily PM10 data were evaluated (correlation coefficient >0.94). These appropriate results imply the ability of the developed input selection technique to make the appropriate selection of the input variables, and it can be introduced as a new input variable selection for the ANN. In addition, a dense PM10 monitoring network was developed by the combination of both the re–constructed (20 stations) and the current (12 stations) stations. This dense monitoring network was applied in order to determine a reliable mean annual PM10 concentration in the different areas in Berlin in 2012."

The model performance was evaluated using various observation data, such as meteorological factors (temperature, relative humidity, and wind field), gaseous pollutants (SO2, NO2, and O3), PM2.5, PM10, and visibility at several measurement stations. The modeled meteorological field and visibility were in good agreement with observations from December 2010. The modeled mass concentrations of gaseous pollutants and aerosol particles also suitably captured the magnitude and variation features of the observation data, especially during the air pollution episode. The simulated results showed that during this pollution episode, low visibility (lower than 10 km) occurred mainly in Beijing, Tianjin, Hebei, and Shandong. The analysis and sensitivity test indicated that the aerosol particles larger than PM2.5 and the water uptake effect of aerosol optical properties could not significantly influence visibility. Thus, the low visibility was primarily caused by the high mass burden of PM2.5as a result of the local pollutant accumulation and long-range transport. Statistics showed that the visibility variation was closely inversely related to the variation in PM2.5 in most regions in the NCP. Visibility decreased lower than 10 km when the mass concentration of PM2.5 exceeded 75 μg m−3 to 85 μg m−3 in the NCP. Sulfate and nitrate were the two major inorganic aerosol components of PM2.5 that evidently decreased visibility by contributing 40% to 45% to the total extinction coefficient value."

A novel feature of the OSRM is a surface conversion module to represent the vertical gradient in ozone arising from chemical loss and deposition to the surface. This has significantly improved the performance of the model, especially in urban areas. In this paper, the modelling system is described and its performance against measured ozone concentrations and metrics and other UK ozone models is discussed. The model has been used to calculate future ozone concentrations in the UK and thus to assess a number of possible control measures developed for the UK Air Quality Strategy."

Two goals can be achieved by using this numerical simulation system: (1) quantifying the emission of anthropogenic heat from buildings and (2) providing accurate parameters relating the urban energy balance to global climate models. As compared with other building energy models, the MBEM has the following features: (1) it proposes a new approach for estimating indoor surface temperatures (roofs and walls surfaces) based on a support vector machine; (2) it uses a time-varying ventilation rate rather than an empirical constant to simulate the sensible heat flux exchange through ventilation; and (3) it considers the heat exchange between windows and the indoor air. Model performance is evaluated against measured sensible heat fluxes in a suburban site where we introduced a footprint model to remove the contributions of nonurban covers. The results indicate that incorporating the MBEM in the CLMU significantly improves sensible heat flux calculations over using the CLMU alone, and that the MBEM is more accurate than other building energy model. To investigate the model structure of the MBEM and the feedbacks between the MBEM and CLMU, we conducted a sensitivity analysis of different parameters and a study of the impacts of building anthropogenic heat on urban air temperature. This urban modeling system is a useful tool for investigating the impacts of urbanization on regional meteorological conditions within the framework of a global climate model."

A typical heavy O3 pollution event occurred in Beijing from July 1 to July 10, 2015. The first two days were defined as clean days with a prevailing northerly wind and low O3 concentrations. The following period from July 3 to July 10 was regarded as polluted days with a prevailing southerly wind and high O3 concentrations. The Integrated Source Apportionment Method (ISAM) implemented in the Regional Atmospheric Modeling System Community Multiscale Air Quality (RAMS-CMAQ) model was applied to quantify the regional contributions to O3 concentrations in Beijing during this pollution episode. The model evaluation shows that the model reproduced the spatiotemporal variations of meteorological conditions (temperature, relative humidity and wind vector) and concentration field (O3 and NO2) well. The diurnal variations of O3 and NOx in both urban and suburban areas are unimodal. The concentration of O3 decreased rapidly in the urban areas after reaching a peak value, but only slowly in the suburbs. The peaks of NOx concentration in suburban areas appear around 05:00 a.m., while those in urban areas appear at 08:00 a.m. With the change in wind direction and enhanced local emissions, the O3 in Beijing was mainly affected by the boundary conditions on clean days and increased by contributions from Tianjin, Hebei, Shandong, and local emissions on polluted days. By contrast, the O3 precursor NO2 was mostly sourced from local and nearby emissions and was only slightly influenced by the meteorological conditions."

The results indicated that the total emissions of Cu and Zn increased from 5137.70 t and 11484.16 t in 1995–7099.24 t and 14536.61 t in 2014, at an annual average growth rate of 1.90% and 1.33%, respectively. The industrial sector ranked as the leading source, followed by power plants, the residential use, and other sectors. The emissions of Cu and Zn were predominantly concentrated in the northern and eastern regions of China due to the enormous consumption of coal by the industrial and the power sectors. The emissions of Cu and Zn were closely associated with mortality and life expectancy (LE) on the basis of multiple regression analysis. Spatial econometric models suggested that Cu and Zn emissions displayed significantly positive relevance with mortality, while they exhibited negative correlation with LE. The influence of the Cu emission peaked in the north of China for both mortality and LE, while the impacts of the Zn emission on mortality and LE reached a maximum value in Xinjiang Province. The results of the grey prediction model suggested that the Cu emission would decrease to 5424.73 t, whereas the Zn emissions could reach 17402.13 t in 2020. Analysis of more specific data are imperative in order to estimate the emissions of both metals, to assess their human health effects, and then to adopt effective measures to prevent environmental pollution."

This combination of high resolution and long time span is critically needed for epidemiological studies and for air pollution control, but still poses a great challenge for current state-of-the-art modelling techniques. The presented method relies on the pre-computation of a discrete set of possible weather situations and corresponding steady-state flow and dispersion patterns. The most suitable situation for any given hour is then selected by matching the simulated wind patterns to meteorological observations in and around the city. The catalogue of pre-computed situations corresponds to different large-scale forcings in terms of wind speed, wind direction and stability. A meteorological model converts these forcings into realistic mesoscale flow patterns accounting for the effects of topography and land-use contrasts in a domain covering the city and its surroundings. These mesoscale patterns serve as boundary conditions for a microscale urban flow model which finally drives a Lagrangian air pollutant dispersion model. The method is demonstrated with the modelling system GRAMM/GRAL v14.8 for two Swiss cities in complex terrain, Zurich and Lausanne. The mesoscale flow patterns in the two regions of interest, dominated by land-lake breezes and driven by the partly steep topography, are well reproduced in the simulations matched to in situ observations. In particular, the combination of wind measurements at different locations around the city appeared to be a robust approach to deduce the stability class for the boundary layer within the city. This information is critical for predicting the temporal variability of pollution concentration within the city, regarding their relationship with the intensity of horizontal and vertical dispersion and of turbulence. In the vicinity of sources, the 5 m resolution chosen in our set-up is not always sufficient to reproduce the very steep concentration gradients, pointing at additional cost optimisations in the method required to make higher resolutions affordable. Nevertheless, the catalogue-based methodology allows reproducing concentration variability very consistently further away from emission sources, hence for most parts of the city."

The final scope is to integrate the new models in traditional traffic management support systems for a sustainable mobility of road vehicles in urban areas. This first stage concerns the relationship between the hourly mean concentration of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and explanatory factors reflecting the NO2 mean level one hour back, along with traffic and weather conditions. Particular attention is given to the prediction of pollution peaks, defined as exceedances of normative concentration limits. Two model frameworks are explored: the Artificial Neural Network approach and the ARIMAX model. Furthermore, the benefit of a synergic use of both models for air quality forecasting is investigated. The analysis of findings points out that the prediction of extreme concentrations is best performed by integrating the two models into an ensemble. The neural network is outperformed by the ARIMAX model in foreseeing peaks, but gives a more realistic representation of the concentration's dependency upon wind characteristics. So, the Neural Network can be exploited to highlight the involved functional forms and improve the ARIMAX model specification. In the end, the study shows that the ability to forecast exceedances of legal pollution limits can be enhanced by requiring traffic management actions when the predicted concentration exceeds a lower threshold than the normative one."

But no study to date has explored fireworks effects on air quality over large regions using systematic observations over multiple years to estimate typical regional PM increases. This study uses observations of fine PM (with particle diameters < 2.5 μm, PM2.5) from 315 air quality monitoring sites across the United States to estimate the effects of Independence Day fireworks on hourly and 24-hr average concentrations. Hourly PM2.5 concentrations during the evening of July 4 and morning of July 5 are higher than on the two preceding and following days in July, considered as control days. On national average, the increases are largest (21 μg/m3) at 9–10 pm on July 4 and drop to zero by noon on July 5. Average concentrations for the 24-hr period beginning 8 pm on July 4 are 5 μg/m3 (42%) greater than on control days, on national average. The magnitude and timing of the Independence Day increases vary from site to site and from year to year, as would be expected given variations in factors such as PM2.5 emissions from fireworks, local meteorological conditions, and distances between fireworks displays and monitoring sites. At one site adjacent to fireworks, hourly PM2.5 levels climb to ∼500 μg/m3, and 24-hr average concentrations increase by 48 μg/m3 (370%). These results have implications for potential improvements in air quality models and their predictions, which currently do not account for this emissions source."

TSPM was found to be the major air pollutant causing significant deterioration of air quality with annual mean concentrations of 280μg/m3. Further, weekly mean air pollutant concentrations were statistically analyzed through stepwise multiple linear regression analysis in respect of independent meteorological variables to develop suitable statistical models. Both NO2 and TSPM concentrations were found to have been influenced by meteorological variables with coefficient of determination (R2) of 82.21 and 92.84%, respectively. However, atmospheric SO2 revealed only 22.87% of dependencies on meteorological variables. Partial correlation coefficients revealed that wind speed has the maximum influence (77.80 and 31.50%) on proposed equations for NO2 and SO2, closely followed by weekly mean temperature (73.60 and 24.30%). However, in case of TSPM, individual contribution of ambient temperature (94.40%) was found maximum, followed by relative humidity (86.50%). Model performances were evaluated through both quantitative data analysis techniques and statistical methods. Nearly 98 and 95% of potential error has been explained by the model developed for TSPM and NO2, while in case of SO2, it is found as only 61%. Therefore, performances of models (for TSPM and NO2) to predict ambient weekly mean concentrations based on forecasted weather parameters were found to be excellent, however, performance of model developed for SO2 was found only satisfactory."

By using our method, it is possible to determine the major wind directions that have large impact on air quality for a particular area. Our results showed that the influence of wind on the concentration of particulate matter and its precursor gases varies spatially over Beijing. Our method suggested that both local emission sources of fine particulate matter and its precursor gas (NO2) and transported SO2 from regional industries should be reduced for the remediation of severe air pollution scenarios, especially in the Beijing urban area. Our approach serves as a good complement for commonly used approaches for source apportionment analysis without exploiting complicated methods. The method shows its feasibility in identifying air pollutant emission sources based on wind patterns and can be used in other regions as an aid in air pollution controlling programs."

In this study, an urban-scale traffic pollution dispersion model is developed considering street distribution, canyon geometry, background meteorology, traffic assignment, traffic emissions and air pollutant dispersion. In the model, vehicle exhausts generated from traffic flows first disperse inside street canyons along the micro-scale wind field generated by computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model. Then, pollutants leave the street canyon and further disperse over the urban area. On the basis of this model, the effects of canyon geometry on the distribution of NOx and CO from traffic emissions were studied over the center of Beijing. We found that an increase in building height leads to heavier pollution inside canyons and lower pollution outside canyons at pedestrian level, resulting in higher domain-averaged concentrations over the area. In addition, canyons with highly even or highly uneven building heights on each side of the street tend to lower the urban-scale air pollution concentrations at pedestrian level. Further, increasing street widths tends to lead to lower pollutant concentrations by reducing emissions and enhancing ventilation simultaneously. Our results indicate that canyon geometry strongly influences human exposure to traffic pollutants in the populated urban area. Carefully planning street layout and canyon geometry while considering traffic demand as well as local weather patterns may significantly reduce inhalation of unhealthy air by urban residents."

In Africa, these problems are acute, especially in the rapidly expanding megacities, and they impact on public health, poverty alleviation and sustainable development. Many cities have become densely overpopulated as a result of migration due to civil wars and the search for a better life. Cities are seen as offering more hope of jobs, better health care and educational opportunities. But these are also home to an overwhelming percentage of a country’s wealth. The rapid expansion of megacities is likely to be a drain on Africa’s dwindling resources, as well as a major call on international aid, while contributing substantially to environmental degradation. African megacities are at risk of geological disasters and pose huge problems for waste management, supply of raw materials, water use, air quality and climate change. Research and practice of urban geology in Africa have seen the development of new outputs to aid urban development, regeneration and conservation. Another key advance has been the realisation that, in the urban environment, knowledge and understanding of the geology need to be integrated with those of other environmental disciplines such as biodiversity and, increasingly, with the research of social scientists, economists and others. At the same time, however, it is recognised that municipal authorities need greater access to extensive databases of geoinformation that are maintained in the long-term, and renewed regularly. We need to demonstrate convincingly to all stakeholders how the geosciences can contribute to sustainable development. This discourse examines the dynamics of geoenvironmental phenomena and processes in Africa’s largest urban settings (Cairo, Lagos and Kinshasa), and uses case studies and city overviews (descriptions and geodata analyses) to show how the application of geology to urban construction and development in Africa should be effectively done. The completeness of urban geotechnical databases is highlighted and their application to environmental construction and related geological problems illustrated. The three megacities provide contrasting geological settings but similar urban architecture. The fact that engineering construction problems are closely controlled by the local or site geological setting, gives for the three cities, a range of scenarios; and proposed solutions or interventions in one area can be usefully applied to tackle problems in another area with similar geology."

A high-performance three-stage model was developed with AOD, meteorological, demographic and land use variables as predictors, which includes a custom-designed PM2.5 gap-filling method. The 11-year average annual coverage increased from 177days to 279days and annual PM2.5 prediction error decreased from 14.1μg/m3 to 8.3μg/m3 after gap-filling techniques were applied. Results show that the 11-year overall mean of predicted PM2.5 was 67.1μg/m3 in our study domain. The cross-validation R2 value of our model is 0.82 in 2013 and 0.79 in 2014.

Based on the literature, several methods, including satellite data, chemical transport models and, less often, personal exposure monitoring are available. However, few investigations have used methods allowing separating wildfires emissions from air pollutants emissions from urban sources having the same components.

Here, mixing height (MH) estimates determined from turbulence measurements of Doppler lidars and aerosol-derived mixed layer height (MLH) based on automatic lidar and ceilometer (ALC) observations within the centre of London are assessed. While MH uncertainty increases with shorter duration of vertical stare sampling within the Doppler lidar scan pattern, instrument-related noise of the ALC may result in large MLH errors due to the challenging task of layer attribution. However, when long time series are assessed most of the algorithm- and instrument-related uncertainties average out and therefore become less critical to overall climatological analyses. Systematic differences occur in nocturnal MH from two nearby (3–4 km) sites but MLH estimates at both sites generally agree with MH obtained at the denser urban setting. During daytime, most spatial variations in ABL structure induced by synoptic conditions or land cover heterogeneity at this scale do not exceed measurement uncertainty. Agreement between MH and MLH is clearly affected by ABL aerosol content and cloud conditions. Discrepancies increase with cloud complexity. On average, MH rises ahead of MLH during the morning growth period and peaks earlier in the day. There is a faster afternoon decay of MLH so that MLH and MH converge again around sunset and often have similar nocturnal values. Results demonstrate that turbulence-derived MH and aerosol-derived MLH should not be used inter-changeably for purposes of model evaluation, interpretation of surface air quality observations or initialisation of chemical transport models."

The knowledge on the dynamics and complexity of air pollutants behavior has made artificial intelligence models as a useful tool for a more accurate pollutant concentration prediction. This paper focuses on an innovative method of daily air pollution prediction using combination of Support Vector Machine (SVM) as predictor and Partial Least Square (PLS) as a data selection tool based on the measured values of CO concentrations. The CO concentrations of Rey monitoring station in the south of Tehran, from Jan. 2007 to Feb. 2011, have been used to test the effectiveness of this method. The hourly CO concentrations have been predicted using the SVM and the hybrid PLS–SVM models. Similarly, daily CO concentrations have been predicted based on the aforementioned four years measured data. Results demonstrated that both models have good prediction ability; however the hybrid PLS–SVM has better accuracy. In the analysis presented in this paper, statistic estimators including relative mean errors, root mean squared errors and the mean absolute relative error have been employed to compare performances of the models. It has been concluded that the errors decrease after size reduction and coefficients of determination increase from 56 to 81% for SVM model to 65–85% for hybrid PLS–SVM model respectively. Also it was found that the hybrid PLS–SVM model required lower computational time than SVM model as expected, hence supporting the more accurate and faster prediction ability of hybrid PLS–SVM model."

abstract = "Background
Numerous studies show associations between exposure to Particulate Matter and Cardiovascular disease (CVD). Current cardiovascular equations incorporate the major risk factors for CVD. The patients' environment, however, is not incorporated in these equations.
Methods
In a retrospective analysis, we assessed the contribution of neighborhood greenness and particulate matter (coarse-PM and PM<2.5μm–PM2.5) to the development of CVD by analyzing the change in prediction abilities. We included members of the largest health-care provider in Southern-Israel, who had at least one cardiovascular risk factor (dyslipidemia, diabetes, hypertension or smokers). PM exposure and neighborhood greenness (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index-NDVI) were assessed by satellite-based models. We used pooled logistic mixed regressions to obtain the CVD risks including conventional risk factors (i.e. age, gender, blood-pressure, etc.) and measured the model performance with and without PM and NDVI.
Results
We included 23,110 subjects, of whom 12% had CVD. Coarse-PM exposure was associated with stroke and Myocardial-Infarction (MI) (OR 1.02,p<0.01 for both). NDVI was associated with MI: OR 0.72(p<0.01) for NDVI 0.1–0.2; and OR 0.52(p=0.270) for NDVI >0.2. The c-statistics slightly improved from 77.30%–77.40% for the prediction of MI (p=0.004) and from 75.60%–75.76% for the prediction of stroke (p=0.027). Calibration was fair in all models. The associations were partially mediated through the patients' comorbidities.
Conclusion
The negligible improvement in the prediction performance, despite significant associations with PM and NDVI, may be due to partial mediation of these associations through the conventional cardiovascular risk factors, suggesting the importance in assessing the environmental effects on more basic physiological pathways when addressing the contribution to the cardiovascular risk."

It is a common site for model-measurement comparison of both chemical and aerosol microphysical variables. However, while the measurement record has aerosol number concentration and optical properties, the number size distribution has not been well-constrained. Measurement highlights include means in number concentration (3–2500 nm), aerosol optical depth, SO2, NH3, and PM2.5 of 6500 cm−3, 0.18, 0.87 ppb, 1.6 ppb, and 8.8 μg m−3, respectively. The mode in the mean size distribution was 31 nm (number) and 287 nm (volume). The mean size distribution was heavily influenced by nuclei mode particles, with 46% of particles smaller than 20 nm. New particle formation and growth events increase midday concentrations of 3–50 nm particles substantially, with the highest activity in spring months and lower activity in summer and winter.

The CHIMERE chemistry-transport model has been used by several research groups to estimate air pollutant concentrations in different European countries. An evaluation of the model performance of the CHIMERE air quality model was carried out for the spring and summer periods of 2003–2005 in Spain, using EMEP emissions. This evaluation has demonstrated a fair agreement between observed and modelled ozone values for background stations, with a mean normalized absolute error below 15% for rural background air quality sites. This value lays inside the range proposed in EPA's guideline for an acceptable level of model performance. In spite of this acceptable model performance, further studies need to be carried out to explain some underestimation found over Madrid surroundings."

For hourly PM2.5 concentration prediction, it is beneficial to split the whole dataset into several subsets with similar properties and to train a local prediction model for each subset. However, the methods based on local models need to solve the global-local duality. In this study, a novel prediction model based on classification and regression tree (CART) and ensemble extreme learning machine (EELM) methods is developed to split the dataset into subsets in a hierarchical fashion and build a prediction model for each leaf. Firstly, CART is used to split the dataset by constructing a shallow hierarchical regression tree. Then at each node of the tree, EELM models are built using the training samples of the node, and hidden neuron numbers are selected to minimize validation errors respectively on the leaves of a sub-tree that takes the node as the root. Finally, for each leaf of the tree, a global and several local EELMs on the path from the root to the leaf are compared, and the one with the smallest validation error on the leaf is chosen. The meteorological data of Yancheng urban area and the air pollutant concentration data from City Monitoring Centre are used to evaluate the method developed. The experimental results demonstrate that the method developed addresses the global-local duality, having better performance than global models including random forest (RF), v-support vector regression (v-SVR) and EELM, and other local models based on season and k-means clustering. The new model has improved the capability of treating multiple change patterns."

This paper proposes a novel technique based on a semi-empirical air pollution model to quantify the impact from a roadway on the air quality of a local neighbourhood using ambient records of a single air pollution monitor. We demonstrate the proposed technique using a case study, in which we quantify the contribution from a major highway with respect to the local background concentration in Auckland, New Zealand. Comparing the diurnal variation of the model-separated background contribution with real measurements from a site upwind of the highway shows that the model estimates are reliable. Amongst all of the pollutants considered, the best estimations of the background were achieved for nitrogen oxides. Although the multi-pronged approach worked well for predominantly vehicle-related pollutants, it could not be used effectively to isolate emissions of PM10 due to the complex and less predictable influence of natural sources (such as marine aerosols). The proposed approach is useful in situations where ambient records from an upwind background station are not available (as required by other techniques) and is potentially transferable to situations such as intersections and arterial roads. Applying this technique to longer time series could help to understand the changes in pollutant concentrations from the road and background sources for different emission scenarios, for different years or seasons. Modelling results also show the potential of such a hybrid semi-empirical models to contribute to our understanding of the physical parameters determining air quality and to validate emissions inventory data."

It is the first attempt to investigate the response of both aerosol mass concentration and number concentration to emission changes using a chemical transport model with detailed aerosol microphysics over mainland China. Results indicate that the response characteristics are obviously different between aerosol particle number concentration and mass concentration. Generally, the response of number concentration shows a more heterogeneous spatial distribution than that of mass concentration. Furthermore, number concentration has a higher sensitivity not only to primary particles emission but also to precursor gases than that of mass concentration. Aerosol particle mass concentration exhibits a consistent trend with the emission change and yet aerosol number concentration does not. Due to the nonlinearity of aerosol microphysical processes, reduction of primary particles emission does not necessarily lead to an obvious decrease of aerosol number concentration and it even increases the aerosol number concentration. Over Central-Eastern China (CEC), the most polluted regions in China, reducing primary particles emission rather than precursor gas emissions is more effective in reducing particles number concentration. By contrast, the opposite is true over the northwestern China. The features of fine particles pollution revealed in this study are associated with the spatial differences in China's population, geography, climate and economy. Considering the more adverse effects of ultrafine particles on human health and the spatial distribution of population, making different measures in controlling particles number concentration from that controlling mass concentration in different regions over mainland China is indicated.
Main findings
FPN concentration responds more heterogeneously to emission than FPM. Spatial difference of response of FPN to emission is distinguished by a boundary line."

The answers to these questions always take into consideration a more practical approach towards the identification of potential risk and subsequent intervention.

Individuals with mental disorders are often susceptible to the effects of extreme ambient temperatures. The aim of this study is to assess the short-term impacts of daily mean temperature on hospitalizations for mental disorders in the Lisbon Metropolitan Area, Portugal.
Methods
To assess the short-term impacts of daily mean temperature on hospitalizations for mental disorders (2008–2014), a quasi-Poisson generalized additive model combined with a distributed lag non-linear model was applied. The model was adjusted for day of the week, air pollution, relative humidity, time and seasonality.
Results
The number of hospital admissions for mental disorder during the study period was 30,139. Hospital admissions increase significantly with high temperatures on day of exposure, at lag 0–1 and at lag 0–2. Women are more vulnerable than men, and there was no difference between the age groups studied.
Conclusions
The exposure to high temperatures should be considered a significant risk factor for mental disorders; therefore, patient management services may need to be strengthened when extreme high temperature alerts are given."

Air pollution in the city (Howrah) is rising in parallel with the economics and thus observing, forecasting and controlling the air pollution becomes increasingly important due to the health impact. ANFIS serve as a basis for constructing a set of fuzzy IF-THEN rules, with appropriate membership functions to generate the stipulated input–output pairs. The ANFIS model predictor considers the value of meteorological factors (pressure, temperature, relative humidity, dew point, visibility, wind speed, and precipitation) and previous day's pollutant concentration in different combinations as the inputs to predict the 1-day advance and same day air pollution concentration. The concentration value of five air pollutants and seven meteorological parameters of the Howrah city during the period 2009 to 2011 were used for development of the ANFIS model. Collinearity tests were conducted to eliminate the redundant input variables. A forward selection (FS) method is used for selecting the different subsets of input variables. Application of collinearity tests and FS techniques reduces the numbers of input variables and subsets which helps in reducing the computational cost and time. The performances of the models were evaluated on the basis of four statistical indices (coefficient of determination, normalized mean square error, index of agreement, and fractional bias)."

Climate change may affect mortality associated with air pollutants, especially for fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and ozone (O3). Projection studies of such kind involve complicated modelling approaches with uncertainties.
Objectives
We conducted a systematic review of researches and methods for projecting future PM2.5-/O3-related mortality to identify the uncertainties and optimal approaches for handling uncertainty.
Methods
A literature search was conducted in October 2013, using the electronic databases: PubMed, Scopus, ScienceDirect, ProQuest, and Web of Science. The search was limited to peer-reviewed journal articles published in English from January 1980 to September 2013.
Discussion
Fifteen studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Most studies reported that an increase of climate change-induced PM2.5 and O3 may result in an increase in mortality. However, little research has been conducted in developing countries with high emissions and dense populations. Additionally, health effects induced by PM2.5 may dominate compared to those caused by O3, but projection studies of PM2.5-related mortality are fewer than those of O3-related mortality. There is a considerable variation in approaches of scenario-based projection researches, which makes it difficult to compare results. Multiple scenarios, models and downscaling methods have been used to reduce uncertainties. However, few studies have discussed what the main source of uncertainties is and which uncertainty could be most effectively reduced.
Conclusions
Projecting air pollution-related mortality requires a systematic consideration of assumptions and uncertainties, which will significantly aid policymakers in efforts to manage potential impacts of PM2.5 and O3 on mortality in the context of climate change."

Studies of air pollution effects on health are often based on ecological measurements. Our aim was to develop spatio-temporal models that estimate daily levels of NO2 and PM10 at every point in space, within the greater Athens area.
Methods
We applied a semiparametric approach using spatial and temporal covariates and a bivariate smooth thin plate function. We evaluated the predictions of our models against the exposure estimates that are typically used in health studies. For model validation we used a temporal and a spatial approach.
Results
The adjusted-R2 of the developed exposure models was 0.53 and 0.75 for PM10 and NO2 respectively; the spatial terms in our models explained 41.5% and 64.5% and the temporal explained 52.85% and 32.0% of the variability in PM10 and NO2, respectively. There was no temporal or spatial left over autocorrelation in the residuals. We performed a leave-one-out cross validation and the adjusted-R2 were 0.41 for PM10 and 0.71 for NO2. The developed model showed good validity when comparing predicted and observed measures for the 2010 data. Our models performed better compared to the “ecological” estimates and estimates based on the “nearest monitoring site”.
Conclusions
Our spatio-temporal model makes valid predictions, it introduces substantial geographical variability, it reduces the bias when compared with the “ecological” estimates and the estimates based on the “nearest monitoring site” and it can be used for a more personalized exposure assessment in health studies."

As a consequence, stresses on space, ecosystems, infrastructures, facilities and personal lifestyles have been enhanced. Problems related to the quality of life in cities are increasingly relevant, especially with regard to environmental issues. Domestic and industrial sources and, primarily, motorised traffic are responsible for pollutant emissions and noise that decisively affect life in modern cities. In this context, evaluating and monitoring urban environmental quality has become an important issue for decision making and planning of more liveable and sustainable cities. Computational simulation models for the phenomena associated with emission and propagation of noise and dispersion of air pollutants were applied within a GIS platform to generate maps of noise and pollutant concentrations. This paper presents an urban environmental quality index: City Noise-Air. In case either one of the environmental conditions (pollutants or noise level) exceeds the accepted limit, the City Noise-Air index will reflect that exceedance and thus equals zero (red). If there is no limit violation, then City Noise-Air incorporates all of the selected conditions into an overall quality index by a multi-criteria combination that allows trade-offs. A case study is presented for Viana do Castelo, a mid-sized Portuguese city, in which City Noise-Air values were calculated taking in consideration the noise level (Lden) and the concentrations of CO, NO2, O3, C6H6 and PM10."

abstract = "Observing the rapid urban expansions and numerous infrastructure developments in the East-Asian context, many cities are suffering the urban heat island (UHI) effect and its associated environmental and social challenges. Moreover, the lack of sufficient attention to the application of effective heat mitigation strategies in current urban development in these cities can drastically intensify the eventual impacts of UHI. Therefore, many governmental sectors and policy makers have been implementing operative solutions for cooling cities. Nevertheless, this study argues that in Kuala Lumpur, despite the growing attention to this matter, there is still a need for more rigorous consideration by the architecture, engineering and construction (AEC) professionals as well as more scholarly studies to reflect sustainable solutions to the UHI effect. As a result, today, some of the dense urban areas in Kuala Lumpur are characterized with the use of thermally massive building materials, urban surfaces with low albedo, complex urban morphology, waste heat, and low density of vegetation. On the other hand, recent studies demonstrate that there has been a rapidly increasing interest in studies related to UHI in other East Asian regions such as Singapore and Hong Kong. Hence, this study develops a comparative analysis to provide a state-of-the-art review of the recent attempts towards mitigating the UHI effect in Kuala Lumpur, Singapore, and Hong Kong. Among several available UHI mitigation strategies, this study is limited to the analysis of the environmental impacts of urban vegetation (green roofs, green facades, vertical greeneries and green pavements). Findings reveal that in general, urban greening can significantly mitigate the UHI intensity, both directly and indirectly, resulting in the decrease of global air temperature and mean radiant temperature up to 4°C and 4.5°C respectively. Overall, the study develops new practical guidelines, discusses the public benefits and elaborates on the future directions of UHI studies."

However, existing methods of air pollutant concentration prediction fail to effectively model long-term dependencies, and most neglect spatial correlations. In this paper, a novel long short-term memory neural network extended (LSTME) model that inherently considers spatiotemporal correlations is proposed for air pollutant concentration prediction. Long short-term memory (LSTM) layers were used to automatically extract inherent useful features from historical air pollutant data, and auxiliary data, including meteorological data and time stamp data, were merged into the proposed model to enhance the performance. Hourly PM2.5 (particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter less than or equal to 2.5 μm) concentration data collected at 12 air quality monitoring stations in Beijing City from Jan/01/2014 to May/28/2016 were used to validate the effectiveness of the proposed LSTME model. Experiments were performed using the spatiotemporal deep learning (STDL) model, the time delay neural network (TDNN) model, the autoregressive moving average (ARMA) model, the support vector regression (SVR) model, and the traditional LSTM NN model, and a comparison of the results demonstrated that the LSTME model is superior to the other statistics-based models. Additionally, the use of auxiliary data improved model performance. For the one-hour prediction tasks, the proposed model performed well and exhibited a mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 11.93%. In addition, we conducted multiscale predictions over different time spans and achieved satisfactory performance, even for 13–24 h prediction tasks (MAPE = 31.47%)."

This source-tagged model system could simultaneously track spatial and temporal sources of SNA, which were apportioned to their respective primary precursors in a simulation run. The results indicate that in the study period, local emissions in Shanghai accounted for over 20% of SNA contributions and that Jiangsu and Shandong were the two major non-local sources. In particular, non-local emissions had higher contributions during recorded pollution periods. This suggests that the transportation of pollutants plays a key role in air pollution in Shanghai. The temporal contributions show that the emissions from the “current day” (emission contribution from the current day during which the model was simulating) contributed 60%–70% of the sulfate and ammonium concentrations but only 10%–20% of the nitrate concentration, while the previous days’ contributions increased during the recorded pollution periods. Emissions that were released within three days contributed over 85% averagely for SNA in January 2013. To evaluate the source-tagged model system, the results were compared by sensitivity analysis (emission perturbation of −30%) and backward trajectory analysis. The consistency of the comparison results indicated that the source-tagged model system can track sources of SNA with reasonable accuracy."

The present study aimed to develop a national-scale exposure prediction model for estimating annual average concentrations of PM10 and NO2 at residences in South Korea using regulatory monitoring data for 2010. Using hourly measurements of PM10 and NO2 at 277 regulatory monitoring sites, we calculated the annual average concentrations at each site. We also computed 322 geographic variables in order to represent plausible local and regional pollution sources. Using these data, we developed universal kriging models, including three summary predictors estimated by partial least squares (PLS). The model performance was evaluated with fivefold cross-validation. In sensitivity analyses, we compared our approach with two alternative approaches, which added regional interactions and replaced the PLS predictors with up to ten selected variables. Finally, we predicted the annual average concentrations of PM10 and NO2 at 83,463 centroids of residential census output areas in South Korea to investigate the population exposure to these pollutants and to compare the exposure levels between monitored and unmonitored areas. The means of the annual average concentrations of PM10 and NO2 for 2010, across regulatory monitoring sites in South Korea, were 51.63 μg/m3 (SD = 8.58) and 25.64 ppb (11.05), respectively. The universal kriging exposure prediction models yielded cross-validated R2s of 0.45 and 0.82 for PM10 and NO2, respectively. Compared to our model, the two alternative approaches gave consistent or worse performances. Population exposure levels in unmonitored areas were lower than in monitored areas. This is the first study that focused on developing a national-scale point wise exposure prediction approach in South Korea, which will allow national exposure assessments and epidemiological research to answer policy-related questions and to draw comparisons among different countries."

There is, however, no universal agreement on how rapidly, regionally, cyclically, or asymmetrically the earth will warm; or on the true impact of global warming on infectious disease outbreaks and natural disasters and their inevitable public-health outcomes. In addition, many other factors influence the emergence and reemergence of infectious diseases in a changing environment including international trade and travel, exotic eating habits, lifestyle and residential choices, host susceptibility, and microbial adaptation. The effects of global warming on rainfall and drought, tropical cyclone and tsunami activity, and mosquito-breeding and ovipositing cycles will have far-reaching public health and safety effects not only on human health and emerging arthropod-borne infectious diseases but also on world food production, air quality, drinking water availability and quality, immigration, urban relocation, and civil unrest. As a result of these and other unrecognized associations temporally linking climate changes, international trade and travel, and human health behaviors, the active responses to inevitable climate changes in a global economy must include combinations of environmental, political, regulatory, socioeconomic, and public health measures."

Comparison between observations and the simulation indicates that the model is able to reproduce the main features of the particle number size distribution. The high number concentration of total particles, up to 26600 cm−3 in observations and 39800 cm−3 in the simulation, indicates the severity of pollution in Beijing. We find that primary particles with secondary species coating and secondary particles together control the particle number size distribution. Secondary particles dominate particle number concentration in the nucleation mode. Primary and secondary particles together determine the temporal evolution and spatial pattern of particle number concentration in the Aitken mode. Primary particles dominate particle number concentration in the accumulation mode. Over Beijing and surrounding areas, secondary particles contribute at least 80% of particle number concentration in the nucleation mode but only 10–20% in the accumulation mode. Nucleation mode particles and accumulation mode particles are anti-phased with each other. Nucleation or primary emissions alone could not explain the formation of the particle number size distribution in Beijing. Nucleation has larger effects on ultrafine particles while primary particles emissions are efficient in producing large particles in the accumulation mode. Reduction in primary particle emissions does not always lead to a decrease in the number concentration of ultrafine particles. Measures to reduce fine particle pollution in terms of particle number concentration may be different from those addressing particle mass concentration."

Commuting in urban traffic micro-environments often leads to a large proportion of total daily exposure and uptake. Cyclists in particular, due to their elevated physical exertion levels and ventilatory parameters, experience higher uptakes of air pollution while commuting relative to less active commuters. A model for predicting minute ventilation of cyclist commuters in the field was developed, and PM10 lung deposited doses were predicted based on this. Sixty healthy volunteers were recruited. Minute ventilation, heart rate, personal air pollution exposure, local meteorological conditions, GPS acquired cycling speed and road topography were continuously monitored during sampling protocols. An artificial neural network (ANN) model for predicting minute ventilation was developed based on these variables and subject characteristics. Predicted values were regressed against measured minute ventilation. A Generalised Additive Model (GAM), a Partial Least Squares (PLS) model and three empirical minute ventilation models were tested in the same manner. The ANN, GAM and PLS predicted minute ventilation levels showed better agreement with measured minute ventilation values (R2=0.82, 0.74 and 0.56 respectively) than the empirical models (R2 values ranging from 0.36 to 0.43). The average percentage error of the ANN modelled minute ventilation (2.5±20.2%) was smallest of all models tested. Lung deposited doses of air pollution were calculated using a human respiratory tract model. Doses calculated utilising ANN modelled minute ventilation demonstrated the best agreement with the lung deposited dose determined using measured minute ventilation. Cycling scenarios were investigated in terms of ANN modelled minute ventilation levels and PM10 lung deposited doses. This study presents a novel method of indirectly measuring cyclists׳ breathing rates in an urban outdoor setting and will have applications in assessing accurate air pollution uptake in cyclists in future research."

In addition to the model’s precision, it is, therefore, beneficial to provide a model that is interpretable, as this can assist in the decision about how and which prevention actions to take. For this purpose, a Genetic Algorithm is proposed that carries out multiple regression analysis by searching for the optimal fictional definition of a prediction model. As such, the obtained model is human interpretable, where the preliminary analysis conducted within this study proved its compliance with the existing studies, while the model itself proved to be considerably more accurate than the present state-of-the-art."

This paper addresses these challenges by: a) proposing a comparative and detailed investigation of various air quality monitoring devices (both fixed and mobile), tested through field measurements and citizen sensing in an eco-neighbourhood from Lorraine, France, and by b) proposing a machine learning approach to evaluate the accuracy and potential of such mobile generated data for air quality prediction. The air quality evaluation consists of three experimenting protocols: a) first, we installed fixed passive tubes for monitoring the nitrogen dioxide concentrations placed in strategic locations highly affected by traffic circulation in an eco-neighbourhood, b) second, we monitored the nitrogen dioxide registered by citizens using smart and mobile pollution units carried at breathing level; results revealed that mobile-captured concentrations were 3–5 times higher than the ones registered by passive-static monitoring tubes and c) third, we compared different mobile pollution stations working simultaneously, which revealed noticeable differences in terms of result variability and sensitivity. Finally, we applied a machine learning modelling by using decision trees and neural networks on the mobile-generated data and show that humidity and noise are the most important factors influencing the prediction of nitrogen dioxide concentrations of mobile stations."

Meteorological conditions play important roles in modulating the ambient concentrations of pollutants through different ways. For example, meteorological variables exert important influences on the formation and fate of pollutants such as ozone and aerosols; meteorological processes (e.g., advection and vertical mixing) dictate the dispersion of pollutants. Thus, accurately simulating meteorological conditions is critical for correctly simulating pollution events. Uncertainties are associated with model treatments for various processes in air quality models. Methods such as ensemble simulation and parameter estimation could potentially improve air quality simulations."

abstract = "Heat-wave is one of key meteorological conditions causing the National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) exceedance event in urban environment. In this study, the Weather Research and Forecasting model coupled with Chemistry (WRF/Chem) was used to investigate an unusual heat-wave driven ozone (O3) exceedance event occurring on May 17–19, 2017 in New York City (NYC) and surrounding areas. The WRF/Chem simulations were conducted over the three nested domains with the finest grid spacing of 1.3 km. The simulations were evaluated with various observational data including in situ measurements of air quality and meteorological variables as well as the Lidar-measured vertical profiles. Overall, the WRF/Chem successfully captured the diurnal variations of air quality (e.g., O3 and nitrogen oxides (NOx)) and meteorological fields during the event. However, the O3 was under-predicted during the daytime peak hours but over-predicted during the nighttime. The under-predictions of O3 were highly associated with over-estimation of the planetary-boundary-layer (PBL) heights and uncertainties of emissions (e.g., NOx, and volatile organic compounds, VOCs), whereas the over-predictions were likely attributed to underestimation of the PBL heights and strong vertical mixing. Several findings are obtained from this study. First, the PBL growth plays a critical role in the development of O3 episode. The maximum PBLH and the largest PBL growth rates on a high O3 day are higher than those on a low O3 day. A strong low-level jet (LLJ) in the lower atmospheric boundary layer with increasing boundary-layer height was observed during the event. Second, the isoprene emissions calculated by the biogenic emission model are under-estimated significantly in the WRF/Chem model, which leads to the underprediction of daily O3 peak values. Third, the process analysis indicates that the local chemical productions are the dominant contributor with the contributions of 63–68% during the ozone-exceedance event."

The results showed that this pollution event was the result of joint action of fog, haze, and fog-haze transformation weather. The pure haze was mainly concentrated at the pollution-transport channel (XY and JM) of Hubei. The explosive growth of PM concentrations was more obvious in XY, JM, and JZ than that in YC, XG, and WH, with the growth and reduction rates of PM2.5 at XY station, at 20.11 and 19.50 μg/(m3·h), respectively. During the explosive growth period, northerly winds were dominant at XY, JM, JZ, XG, and WH stations, with large and weak wind speed (WS) resulted in significantly increased PM2.5 concentrations in XY and JM (transport), and in JM, JZ, and YC (accumulation), respectively. The height of northward airflow reached 2000 m in the main pollutant transport channel of Hubei. The upper and lower inversion layers would be enhanced before the explosive growth of PM concentration significantly, then be weakened by continuous transport of the northerly airflow. The concentrations of SO2, NO2, and CO decreased with the increase in WS during the explosive growth period, and O3 concentration reached maximum value at a WS of 3.5–5 m/s. The correlation analysis indicated significant differences in the effects of transport and accumulation."

Vertical atmospheric conditions have strong effects on vertical mixing of air pollutants, which directly affects surface air quality. The characteristics and magnitude of how vertical atmospheric conditions affect surface air quality, which are critical to future air quality projections, have not yet been fully understood. This study aims to enhance understanding of the annual and seasonal sensitivities of air pollution to both surface and vertical atmospheric conditions. Based on both surface and vertical meteorological characteristics provided by 1994–2003 monthly dynamic downscaling data from the Weather and Research Forecast Model, we develop generalized linear models (GLMs) to study the relationships between surface air pollutants (ozone, respirable suspended particulates, and sulfur dioxide) and atmospheric conditions in the Pearl River Delta (PRD) region. Applying Principal Component Regression (PCR) to address multi-collinearity, we study the contributions of various meteorological variables to pollutants’ concentration levels based on the loading and model coefficient of major principal components. Our results show that relatively high pollutant concentration occurs under relatively low mid-level troposphere temperature gradients, low relative humidity, weak southerly wind (or strong northerly wind) and weak westerly wind (or strong easterly wind). Moreover, the correlations vary among pollutant species, seasons, and meteorological variables at various altitudes. In general, pollutant sensitivity to meteorological variables is found to be greater in winter than in other seasons, and the sensitivity of ozone to meteorology differs from that of the other two pollutants. Applying our GLMs to anomalous air pollution episodes, we find that meteorological variables up to mid troposphere (∼700 mb) play an important role in influencing surface air quality, pinpointing the significant and unique associations between meteorological variables at higher altitudes and surface air quality."

No cytotoxicity was detected in summer samples from the rural site and the urban samples, while aromatase activity was moderately inhibited in these samples. In the urban area, the street site samples, collected close to intensive traffic, showed stronger inhibition of aromatase activity than the samples simultaneously collected at a roof site, 50 m above ground level. The cytotoxicity and endocrine disruption potential of the samples were linked to combustion products, i.e. PAH and O-PAH, especially from biomass burning in the rural site in winter."

Thus the continuous monitoring of particulate matter (PM) in underground station is important to evaluate the exposure level of PM to passengers. However, it is difficult to obtain indoor PM data because the measurement systems are expensive and difficult to install and operate for significant periods of time in spaces crowded with people. In this study, we predicted the indoor PM concentration using the information of outdoor PM, the number of subway trains running, and information on ventilation operation by the artificial neural network (ANN) model. As well, we investigated the relationship between ANN’s performance and the depth of underground subway station. ANN model showed a high correlation between the predicted and actual measured values and it was able to predict 67∼80% of PM at 6 subway station. In addition, we found that platform shape and depth influenced the model performance."

The objective of this paper is to develop and test an analytical model that could be applied to predict next day's maximum ozone concentration for the first time in Tirana, Albania, where ozone's monitoring has been recently started. The relationship of the daily maximum hourly ozone values with meteorological variables, including near surface air temperature and relative humidity and with air pollution variables like the persistency of ozone levels and its seasonal variation is examined. The data analysis reveals that the pollution persistency and the near surface air temperature are the factors that mainly affect the peak ozone levels. Multiple linear regression analysis has been performed to establish the relationship between the above mentioned parameters and peak ozone concentration. The agreement between observed and predicted daily maximum hourly ozone values is very good, with a correlation coefficient (R) of 0.87. The model slightly under–predicts the ozone concentration while no significant mispredictions are observed. Additionally, the model’s ability to predict the exceedances of a specific ozone limit value is examined. The model successfully predicts the exceedances of 105μg m−3, a value that corresponds to the 75th percentile, in the 86% of the cases applied."

Since 2013, the WRF-SMOKE-CMAQ model system has been used to build an air quality model system for daily air quality forecasting in Xi'an. The emission inventory was built based on several anthropogenic emission inventories and open access emission datasets, and the model evaluation is presented to verify the emission inventory for particulate matter in Xi'an. Comparing the daily observed and simulated fine particulate (PM2.5) concentrations for four winters in different years (from 2014 to 2017), the model performs well in all studied time periods. The correlation coefficient of the simulated daily PM2.5 concentration data are all larger than 0.58, reaches 0.80 in 2016, and the fraction of predictions within a factor of two of observations (FAC2) are all above 66%. The differences of simulated results based on emission-unchanged system between 2014 and 2015 indicate that the slightly deteriorating air quality of 2015 is affected by the unfavorable air diffusion condition. The PM10 concentration increases from 95.9 μg/m3 to 110.3 μg/m3, and the PM2.5 from 82.4 μg/m3 to 95.4 μg/m3. According to the error analysis in model performance, the serious polluted situation of 2016 is mostly because of the sharp increased dust emissions. The emission-unchanged simulated particulate matter concentrations have little variation from 2015 to 2016, but the observation data increase obviously, that results in dramatically change of Mean Bias (MB). The absolute MB of PM10 increase from 70.3 μg/m3 to 135.2 μg/m3, and PM2.5 from 0.46 μg/m3 to 69.9 μg/m3. While the improved air quality in 2017 is attributed to both the better weather condition and the emission-reductions. The emission-unchanged simulated results decrease, and the absolute MB even have bigger decrease, that of the PM10 concentration reduce by 47μg/m3, and PM2.5 by 37μg/m3."

Air quality in South of France and more specifically in Nice, is known to be bad, especially in summer. The non-parametric Mann–Kendall test has been developed for detecting and estimating monotonic trends in the time series and applied in our study at annual values of pollutants air concentrations and mortality. An important objective of many environmental monitoring programs is to detect changes or trends in pollution levels over time. Over the period 1990–2005, concerning the emissions of main pollutants, we obtained significant decreasing trends. By considering the ozone mean values in urban areas over the 1997–2005 period, an increase of 3.0% year−1 was obtained with annual averages and 3.9% year−1 with median values. A clear increasing trend for PM10 ambient concentrations is obtained. In addition, we observed an increase of the Olea (and Grass) pollination season. Over the same period, an annual change rate of +0.31% year−1 for “airway diseases” and of +2.50% year−1 for “unknown causes” were identified in the “Alpes Maritimes” county. To see the results, there seems to be a short-term link between the levels of these pollutants and mortality for respiratory causes. The other pollutants concentration showed a downward trend reflecting the reduction policy of the emissions. In addition, we obtained significant decreasing trends concerning the “ischemic heart diseases” (−1.20% year−1) and “asthma” (−4.03% year−1) categories. No significant gender-related difference was identified for these groups."

In this study, the health and economic benefits associated with PM2.5 reductions in PRD during 2013–2015 were estimated using the Environmental Benefits Mapping and Analysis Program-Community Edition (BenMAP-CE) software. To create reliable gridded PM2.5 surfaces for BenMAP-CE calculations, a data fusion tool which incorporates the accuracy of monitoring data and the spatial coverage of predictions from the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model has been developed. The population-weighted average PM2.5 concentration over PRD was predicted to decline by 24%. PM2.5-related mortality was estimated to decrease by more than 3800 due to decreases in stroke (48%), ischemic heart disease (IHD) (35%), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (10%), and lung cancer (LC) (7%). A 13% reduction in PM2.5-related premature deaths from these four causes yielded a large economic benefit of about 1300 million US dollars. Our research suggests that the Action Plan played a major role in reducing emissions and additional measures should be implemented to further reduce PM2.5 pollution and protect public health in the future."

The NMM–CMAQ and ARW–CMAQ models were run on the basis of their original grid structures of the meteorological models. The results at the AIRNow surface sites showed that the model performance for ARW–CMAQ and NMM–CMAQ models was similar and reasonable for the high maximum 8–hr O3 concentration range (>40ppbv) with slightly better performance for ARW–CMAQ [the normalized mean bias (NMB) values of ARW–CMAQ and NMM–CMAQ are 8.1 and 9.4%, respectively]. The results of the evaluation using aircraft observations over the Houston–Galveston–Brazoria and Dallas metropolitan areas revealed that both models had similar performances for different chemical species (O3, CO, PAN, NO2, NO, NOX, HNO3, NOY and ethylene) as both models use the same chemical mechanism and emissions. Both models reproduced the vertical variation patterns of the observed air temperature and water vapor well with the slightly lower values for the ARW–CMAQ model. The evaluation results with ship observations over the Gulf of Mexico showed that both models captured, with a good deal of accuracy, the temporal variations and broad synoptic change seen in the observed O3, NOY, CO and O3+NO2 with the mean NMB value <25% most of the time."

Organic carbon showed strong seasonal variation with high concentrations during the heating season and low concentrations during the summer. Elemental carbon did not show strong seasonality due to the continuous influence of heavy traffic. Diurnal variations of OC and EC were characterized by high concentrations during the morning and evening rush hours, and low concentrations in the middle of the day due to the dilution effect of an increased mixing layer. Formation of secondary organic carbon was uncertain during the summer due to dilution and low primary organic carbon emissions. Concentrations heavily depended on surface wind speed. Average OC concentrations were 56–72% higher at wind speeds lower than 2 m s−1 compared to that at wind speeds higher than 3 m s−1 during fall and winter. Higher EC concentrations (15–56%) were observed at wind speeds higher than 3 m s−1, showing that in addition to traffic emissions, EC was transported from nearby areas. Continuous measurements of high time resolved OC and EC are necessary for the development and evaluation of air pollution mitigation strategies, particularly from combustion sources."

Air quality and meteorological data during ozone seasons (Apr. 1st – Oct. 31st) from 2003 to 2005 are used to build site–specific prediction models. Data of ozone season from 2006 to 2007 are used to test these models. Compared to linear regression models (LM), generalized linear models (GLMs), multilayer perceptron (MLP) and support vector machine (SVM), GLMM which considers differences in ozone formation and diffusion in distinct weather patterns has the smallest fitting and prediction error on ozone exceedances and can detect the most number of exceedance days correctly."

abstract = "Urban planners need tools to manage urban growth without compromising the citizens’ quality of life. Urban vegetation plays an important role in regulating local climate and improving air quality. Further, urban vegetation provides non quantifiable psychological and aesthetic benefits. On the other hand, vegetation also has negative impacts, such as allergen risk due to pollen dispersion. This paper investigates the effects of urbanization on tree phenology, exploring the intra-urban variability of Tilia×europaea L. flowering in Florence (Italy). Phenological observations were related to local air temperature, distance from the city center, impervious surfaces and building density. Data collected were used to test whether urban characteristics could be used to describe phenophase timing differences in the city. These differences are explained both by seasonal temperature variation as well as by impervious surface density. In fact T.×europaea flowering occurred first in the areas with a higher percentage of impervious surfaces. Both the start and end of flowering advanced by 1.4 days with a 10% increase in impervious surfaces. Our results suggest a potential application of the “impervious surfaces” urban morphology indicator to predict phenological shifts in an urban environment. These indicators can be processed by geographic information system tools to produce phenological maps of a specific urban area or future urban planning scenarios. This information can be used to improve the evaluation of the benefits and drawbacks of trees, such as their impact on local temperatures, the aesthetic improvement of the urban landscape or the negative effects on human health due to the risk of pollen allergy during the flowering period."

abstract = "Ground–level ozone (O3) is known to exhibit strong daily variations that lead to complexity of the pollutants’ analysis and predictions. This study aimed to introduce and explore the variations in O3 concentrations during daytime (DT), nighttime (NT), and critical conversion time (CCT) using multiple linear regression (MLR) and principal component regression (PCR) analyses. The original variables and principal component analysis (PCA) results were used as the input for MLR analysis. Hourly averages of six air pollutants and four meteorological parameters at Shah Alam during 1999–2009 were selected for this study. The monitoring records in 2010 were used to assess the developed models using several performance indicators. Results showed that the MLR model during DT exhibited optimal performance in terms of normalized absolute error, index of agreement, prediction accuracy, and coefficient of determination (R2) with values of 0.2762, 0.9211, 0.8581, and 0.7354, respectively. PCR during CCT also showed significantly higher performance than that during DT and NT. This result was evidenced by higher percentage of total variances, which could be explained by the selected variables in PCA during CCT."
