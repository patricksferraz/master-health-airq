abstract = "Concentrations of nine trace elements (Ba, Cd, Cr, Cu, Mn, Ni, Pb, Tl and Zn) were measured in a plant bearing allergenic pollens (ragweed) and their transfers from soils to the roots and then to the pollens were investigated. The soil, roots and pollens collected from flowers were sampled at 26 urban sites. Soil pH, soil organic carbon and total-recoverable trace elements (TE) in soil, roots and pollens were measured. The three biogeochemical compartments are well discriminated according to their TE concentrations. The concentrations (in μgg−1) in pollens decreased as follow: Zn (59.5–205)>Mn (19.4–117)>Ba≈Cr≈Cu≈Ni≈Pb (0.54–27.7)>Cd (0.06–0.77)≫Tl (0.0015–0.0180). Mean elemental allocation within ragweed always favored roots over pollen but, at site level, inverse pattern is also observed mostly for Zn and slightly for Cu and Ni. Significant predictive models of TE concentrations in pollens were obtained using soil or root properties only for Cd, Ni and Pb. They all involved positive relationships between TE concentrations in pollens and in soil or roots. Estimates of short-term exposure of human to TE carried out by ragweed pollens indicate TE absorption of less than 50ng, far below thresholds of air quality criteria. Investigating the TE chemistry of pollens is a required first step to validate the impact of TE in pollens on human health and on the prevalence and intensity of allergy symptoms and atopic diseases."

In contrast to previous versions, the new implementation takes into account the shielding of noise at building facades. The simplified approach is based on German noise modeling guidelines. As a proof of concept, a comparative calculation of noise immissions for a use case in the city of Munich with and without the consideration of buildings reveals more realistic immission values when shielding is taken into account. While uncovered areas are not affected by the updated calculation, backyards and areas behind larger building blocks show a major reduction in immissions. When looking at noise exposure costs in a dense area, ignoring the effect of shielding seems to significantly overestimate costs by up to 20%. The presented approach is a step forwards incorporating environmental aspects in an agent-based integrated land use/transport modeling suite."

This is why the literature related to predicting NOx levels is certainly extensive. However, most of this literature does not take into account the spatio-temporal dependencies of such NOx levels. As spatio-temporal dependencies are a core aspect of pollution, we propose both a spatio-temporal kriging and a functional kriging strategy to incorporate such dependencies into the prediction procedure. We also use an innovative method for estimating the parameters of the non separable space–time covariance function involved in the spatio-temporal kriging strategy, which significantly reduces the computational burden of traditional likelihood-based methods. The empirical study focuses on Madrid City and is backed by a massive hourly database. Results indicate that the functional strategy outperforms the spatio-temporal procedure at non peripheral sites, which is a remarkable finding due to the high computational requirements of spatio-temporal kriging."

Green space can provide critical ecosystem services, and increasing the supply of green space can reduce PM pollution, but effects of green spaces on PM at different scales are not clear. Based on the traffic and meteorological factors from 50 monitoring stations, principal composition cluster analysis (PCA) and hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) were implemented. Daily PMs (PM10 and PM2.5) concentrations were measured at 50 monitoring stations in Zhejiang (1 Feb 2015 to 28 Feb 2017) to quantify the spatiotemporal change of PM concentration and its empirical relationship with green spaces and landscape structure. The result shows: (1) At 5-km, or smaller, scale, the correlation between green space and PM2.5 is stronger than PM10; (2) at 2-km scale or less, the total edge length has more impact on PMs than green cover area, while at 3–5-km scale, the influence of green cover is more dominated; (3) In the mountain and hilly area in Zhejiang that are dominated by meteorological factors, we can establish the PM2.5 forecast model by 3–4-km scale green spaces, while in those basins or low lands, we can build the PM2.5 forecast model by using 1–2-km scale green spaces. The results are of great importance for urban green space planning, especially when it comes to the size and shape of the green space. In addition, it can provide guidance to the future application of LUR model in Zhejiang area."

Human health is dependent upon environmental exposures, yet the diversity and variation in exposures are poorly understood. We developed a sensitive method to monitor personal airborne biological and chemical exposures and followed the personal exposomes of 15 individuals for up to 890 days and over 66 distinct geographical locations. We found that individuals are potentially exposed to thousands of pan-domain species and chemical compounds, including insecticides and carcinogens. Personal biological and chemical exposomes are highly dynamic and vary spatiotemporally, even for individuals located in the same general geographical region. Integrated analysis of biological and chemical exposomes revealed strong location-dependent relationships. Finally, construction of an exposome interaction network demonstrated the presence of distinct yet interconnected human- and environment-centric clouds, comprised of interacting ecosystems such as human, flora, pets, and arthropods. Overall, we demonstrate that human exposomes are diverse, dynamic, spatiotemporally-driven interaction networks with the potential to impact human health."

These recent studies often report moderate predictive power, which can generate downward bias in effect estimates. In addition, AOD measurements have only moderate spatial resolution, and have substantial missing data. We make use of recent advances in MODIS satellite data processing algorithms (Multi-Angle Implementation of Atmospheric Correction (MAIAC), which allow us to use 1 km (versus currently available 10 km) resolution AOD data. We developed and cross validated models to predict daily PM2.5 at a 1 × 1 km resolution across the northeastern USA (New England, New York and New Jersey) for the years 2003–2011, allowing us to better differentiate daily and long term exposure between urban, suburban, and rural areas. Additionally, we developed an approach that allows us to generate daily high-resolution 200 m localized predictions representing deviations from the area 1 × 1 km grid predictions. We used mixed models regressing PM2.5 measurements against day-specific random intercepts, and fixed and random AOD and temperature slopes. We then use generalized additive mixed models with spatial smoothing to generate grid cell predictions when AOD was missing. Finally, to get 200 m localized predictions, we regressed the residuals from the final model for each monitor against the local spatial and temporal variables at each monitoring site. Our model performance was excellent (mean out-of-sample R2 = 0.88). The spatial and temporal components of the out-of-sample results also presented very good fits to the withheld data (R2 = 0.87, R2 = 0.87). In addition, our results revealed very little bias in the predicted concentrations (Slope of predictions versus withheld observations = 0.99). Our daily model results show high predictive accuracy at high spatial resolutions and will be useful in reconstructing exposure histories for epidemiological studies across this region."

Measurements were performed on the premises of a monitoring station located in downtown Monterrey. The highest concentrations were found in the fall; the two spring measurements exhibited no statistically significant differences. VOC concentrations exhibited a marked diurnal behavior with higher concentrations during the morning intervals. Solar radiation peaked during the noon interval, allowing for greater secondary pollutant production. VOCs reached their lowest levels in the 14:00–18:00 time interval. Correlation analysis found evidence of mobile sources, fugitive fuel emissions, and the use of solvents as possible sources of the majority of the compounds. Additionally, the VOC–O3–NOx relationship was studied. The results indicate that the atmosphere in Monterrey, Mexico is sensitive to the concentration of VOCs."

Hence, the aim of this study was to predict the amount of CO2 emissions from energy use in Thailand's transportation sector as well as related factors, thus providing a substantial benefit to determine policies for reducing GHG emissions and its impacts. In this study, 5 independent variables, namely the size of the population, gross domestic product (GDP), and the number of small, medium and large-sized registered vehicles, were considered in the forecasting of the CO2 amount released from transportation energy consumption using 4 techniques: log-linear regression, path analysis, time series, and curve estimation. According to the findings, the time series exemplified the minimum mean absolute percent error (MAPE=5.388), followed by the log-linear regression model (MAPE=6.379). The results, based on a path analysis model, indicated the significant effects of the large-sized registered vehicle numbers, GDP, and population on the amount of CO2 emissions. With the CO2 emission forecast, the maximum predicted value was 225.33 million tons by 2030 using curve estimation (cubic), and the minimum predicted value was 91.68 million tons using log-linear regression."

However, the vast amount of AOD data that is missing due to retrieval incapability above bright reflecting surfaces such as cloud/snow cover and urban areas challenge this application. Furthermore, most previous studies cannot directly account for the spatiotemporal autocorrelations in PM2.5 distribution, impacting the associated estimation accuracy. In this study, fixed rank smoothing was adopted to fill the data gaps in a semifinished 3 km AOD dataset, which was a combination of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) 3 km Dark Target AOD data and MODIS 10 km Deep Blue AOD data from the Terra and Aqua satellites. By matching the gap-filled 3 km AOD data, ground-based PM2.5 observations, and auxiliary variable data, sufficient samples were screened to develop a spatiotemporal regression kriging (STRK) model for PM2.5 estimation. The STRK model achieved notable performance in a cross-validation experiment, with a R square of 0.87 and root-mean-square error of 16.55 μg/m3 when applied to estimate daily ground-level PM2.5 concentrations over East China from March 1, 2015 to February 29, 2016. Using the STRK model, daily PM2.5 concentrations with full spatial coverage at a resolution of 3 km were generated. The PM2.5 distribution pattern over East China can be identified at a relatively fine spatiotemporal scale. Thus, the STRK model with gap-filled high-resolution AOD data can provide reliable full-coverage PM2.5 estimations over large areas for long-term exposure assessment in epidemiological studies."

As many of the modeling applications over PSEA or EA were usually evaluated with limited regional or local observations focusing on short simulation periods, in this work we incorporated ground surface measurements from multiple networks covering different sub-regions and satellite retrievals to comprehensively examine the performance of WRF/CMAQ and probe into the possible uncertainties of the modeling system. We found increasing simulation discrepancy for CO, NO2, and SO2 from 2006 to 2010 at south part of PSEA (≤17°N) due to outmoded anthropogenic emission in INTEX-B, while local surface observations and CO2 emission data from World Bank suggested substantial growth of anthropogenic emission over PSEA during the 5 years. The spatial allocation of emission based on population distribution was also found to introduce large uncertainty with overestimation at populated urban area and underestimation at industry area. Over north PSEA (>17°N) CMAQ systematically overestimated CO, surface NO2, troposheric column NO2 by around 6%–20%, 8–15%, and 40%–50% respectively, indicating positive bias within the biomass burning emission due to overestimated emission factor as suggested by OMI retrievals. At EA, despite moderate overestimations for surface NO2 and SO2 by 20%–30% and moderate underestimation for AOD by 30%–50%, no significant temporal trend was found. We found CMAQ underestimated PM10 concentrations at north and northeast EA by 50%–60% due to impact of dust storm, yet the dust plume rise scheme within the model was unable to reproduce it. Our results suggested that an urgent research effort is needed for updating the anthropogenic emission of PSEA countries, and the dust emission module within CMAQ need further improvement for applications over EA."

The addition of a non-aqueous-phase (NAP) with a high affinity for the gas pollutant to packed bed or suspended-growth bioreactor configurations has resulted in enhanced elimination capacities and process robustness. Despite recent research has just added more desired characteristics to the selection criteria of the optimum NAP in gas treatment applications, silicone oil continues being the most popular mass transfer vector. This technology has been successfully applied to the treatment of hexane, methane, styrene, alpha-pinene and BTEX in biofilters, biotrickling filters, stirred tank and airlift bioreactors. The maximum potential of two-phase partitioning bioreactors (TPPBs) during off-gas treatment is achieved when the microbial community is confined inside the NAP. TPPB modeling has also experienced significant advances, the most advanced platforms being able to describe the recent findings in the field.

However, little attention has been paid so far to quantifying the relationship between environment changes and their impact on our bodies in real-life settings. In this paper, we identify a data driven approach based on direct and continuous sensor data to assess the impact of the surrounding environment and physiological changes and emotion. We aim at investigating the potential of fusing on-body physiological signals, environmental sensory data and on-line self-report emotion measures in order to achieve the following objectives: (1) model the short term impact of the ambient environment on human body, (2) predict emotions based on-body sensors and environmental data. To achieve this, we have conducted a real-world study ‘in the wild’ with on-body and mobile sensors. Data was collected from participants walking around Nottingham city centre, in order to develop analytical and predictive models. Multiple regression, after allowing for possible confounders, showed a noticeable correlation between noise exposure and heart rate. Similarly, UV and environmental noise have been shown to have a noticeable effect on changes in ElectroDermal Activity (EDA). Air pressure demonstrated the greatest contribution towards the detected changes in body temperature and motion. Also, significant correlation was found between air pressure and heart rate. Finally, decision fusion of the classification results from different modalities is performed. To the best of our knowledge this work presents the first attempt at fusing and modelling data from environmental and physiological sources collected from sensors in a real-world setting."

abstract = "Publisher Summary
External or social costs of freight transportation have received increased attention recently in development strategies because of sustainability issues. A widely accepted definition of sustainable development is “development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.” Strategies for sustainable transportation consider economic development, environmental preservation, and social development. But as the negative impacts of freight transportation increase, achieving sustainability goals becomes ever more challenging. Freight transportation is a primary component of all supply-chain and logistics systems. However, the cost of moving commodities between cities and countries is borne not only by direct stakeholders but also by other members of society who may not benefit directly from these movements. In economics literature, this is referred to as the external cost of an activity. Air, noise, and water pollution; vegetation and wildlife destruction; and road accidents are some of the negative impacts of freight transportation. Freight movements and their associated negative impacts have been steadily increasing over the last few decades in most parts of the world. Negative environmental effects of freight transportation are a serious concern, because of the associated long-term direct and indirect impacts such as increasing greenhouse gases (GHGs) and global warming."

The levels of the inorganic components in PM2.5 and PM10 were compared with those measured in the same city during the period December 2004–November 2005. A reduction of 12% and 24% in the annual concentrations of PM2.5 and PM10, respectively, was observed from 2004–05 to 2008–09. The decrease in PM2.5 was mainly attributed to a steep reduction in (NH4)2SO4 levels caused by a significant decline in SO2 emissions, higher precipitation rates, and a lower occurrence of winter PM episodes under high atmospheric stability conditions. In the PM10 fraction, NH4+, Ca2+ and SO42− experienced the largest decreases. The drop in Ca2+ levels, higher in winter than in summer, was mainly attributed to the increase in precipitation and the reduction in construction activity. The PM1 annual average concentration in 2008–09 was only 9.2μg/m3. Slightly higher PM1 levels were measured in summer (10.1μg/m3) than in winter (8.8μg/m3), due to the low frequency of local pollution episodes during winter 2009. The PCA analysis identified the contribution of three sources of ionic compounds in the submicron fraction: secondary (NH4)2SO4 and NH4NO3, traffic emissions, and dust resuspension. NO3− size distribution exhibited a marked seasonal pattern, with a lower proportion associated with particles smaller than 2.5μm in summer than in winter, due to the thermal decomposition of NH4NO3. In contrast, the SO42− size distribution was approximately constant throughout the year."

Particulate matter < 2.5 μm in diameter (PM2.5) and heat are strong predictors of morbidity, yet few studies have examined the effects of long-term exposures on non-fatal events, or assessed the short and long-term effect on health simultaneously.
Objective
We jointly investigated the association of short and long-term exposures to PM2.5 and temperature with hospital admissions, and explored the modification of the associations with the short-term exposures by one another and by temperature variability.
Methods
Daily ZIP code counts of respiratory, cardiac and stroke admissions of adults ≥65 (N = 2,015,660) were constructed across New-England (2001−2011). Daily PM2.5 and temperature exposure estimates were obtained from satellite-based spatio-temporally resolved models. For each admission cause, a Poisson regression was fit on short and long-term exposures, with a random intercept for ZIP code. Modifications of the short-term effects were tested by adding interaction terms with temperature, PM2.5 and temperature variability.
Results
Associations between short and long-term exposures were observed for all of the outcomes, with stronger effects of long-term exposures to PM2.5. For respiratory admissions, the short-term PM2.5 effect (percent increase per IQR) was larger on warmer days (1.12% versus −0.53%) and in months of higher temperature variability (1.63% versus −0.45%). The short-term temperature effect was higher in months of higher temperature variability as well. For cardiac admissions, the PM2.5 effect was larger on colder days (0.56% versus −0.30%) and in months of higher temperature variability (0.99% versus −0.56%).
Conclusions
We observed synergistic effects of short-term exposures to PM2.5, temperature and temperature variability. Long-term exposures to PM2.5 were associated with larger effects compared to short-term exposures."

abstract = "This study presents an evaluation of the impact by future pollutant anthropogenic emission reductions on summertime aerosol feedbacks over the Po valley. The fully coupled on line model Wrf/Chem has been used to examine the air quality and meteorology response over the region to 2020 emission reductions with respect to a simulation base case (2013). Future changes in net short wave radiation flux (SW) are also analyzed. The model domain is a 6 × 6 km2 resolution grid over Northern Italy; the simulation period covers two summer months (July–August). The work is divided into two parts. In the first, model results for the Base Case simulation (BC) are evaluated by comparing Wrf/Chem output to surface observations provided by two monitoring networks. Approximately 25 sites belonging to the regional ARPA Lombardia Network are used for both chemistry (NO2, O3 and PM10 concentrations) and meteorology (wind speed and 2-meters temperature) evaluation; 4 stations part of the global AEROsol Robotic Network (AERONET) are used for the evaluation of Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD). In the second part, a Maximum Feasible Reduction (MFR) scenario at 2020 have been simulated for the same months; monthly direct, indirect and overall aerosols feedbacks for both BC and MFR have been computed and analyzed. The emission reductions in the MFR 2020 lead to a sensible change in the aerosol overall feedbacks for all variables; a drop of SW over the valley (cooling effect) is visible in both BC and MFR, but it is less significant in the MFR (−5 W m−2) compared to the BC (−45 W m−2). This difference is mainly due to the abatement of SO2 primary emissions, which leads to lower sulfates concentrations scattering radiation, thus mitigates the cooling effect and favors the warming. As SW is higher in the MFR, T2 also increases over land with respect to the BC (the cooling of −0.5 °C estimated in the Base Case almost disappears). The overall effects lead to an enhancement of PM10 concentration in the BC; they are less efficient in the MFR because of lower secondary aerosol concentrations (associated to the reduction of primary PM10 emissions by approximately 20%). Concerning NO2, some localized areas with high reductions in the BC are not visible in the MFR. This is consistent with the increase of T2, which leads to higher photolytic rates compared to the BC. Higher concentrations of NO2 in the MFR with respect to the BC lead to lower O3 concentrations (maximum O3 values drop from +6 ppb to +3 ppb)."

Four two-day episodes in 2010 are chosen based on plume transport patterns: 1) May 15–16 (plume north), 2) May 29–30 (plume southwest), 3) June 4–5 (plume east), and 4) June 13–14 (plume southeast). Generally, the predicted O3 spatial patterns and temporal variations agree well with the observations at the ambient monitoring sites in the San Diego-Tijuana region, but in the Calexico–Mexicali region, the model frequently underestimates the observation. In the San Diego−Tijuana region, the morning anthropogenic precursor emissions in the urbanized coastal plain are carried inland and mixed with the local biogenic emissions during transport, causing the high O3 level over the mountain region. Biogenic emissions enhance the O3 concentrations by up to 40 ppb over the mountain region in the afternoon. The factor separation approach is used to evaluate the contributions of trans-boundary transport of emissions from California and Baja California to the O3 level in the California–Mexico border region. The Baja California emissions play a minor role in the O3 formation in the San Diego region and do not seem to contribute to the O3 exceedances in the region, but have large potential to cause O3 exceedances in the Calexico region. The California emissions can considerably enhance the O3 level in the Tijuana region. Generally, the California emissions play a more important role than the Baja California emissions on O3 formation in the border region (within 40 km to the California–Mexico border). On average, the O3 concentrations in the border region are decreased by 2–4 ppb in the afternoon due to the interactions of emissions from California and Baja California. Further studies need to be conducted to improve the sea breeze simulations in the border region for evaluating O3 formation."

For NEVs, the scientific prediction of market scale is the guarantee to formulate the effective policy planning. Considering the competition and substitution phenomenon between traditional fuel vehicles (TFVs) and NEVs, we propose a system dynamics (SD) model to investigate and predict the market evolution of NEVs and TFVs in China based on the competitive Lotka-Volterra (LV) model. Furthermore, the effect mechanism of key model parameters is evaluated by sensitivity analysis. Finally, the potential environmental impacts of NEVs in China are analyzed based on the above simulation results. It shows that NEVs will continue to grow rapidly in the coming decades and will dominate in Chinese vehicle market around 2050. Government subsidies and other consumption stimulus factors are the main driving force for NEVs development in its early stages, however, along with the policy stimulus and policy influence gradually weakening, growth in later stages will rely on convenience factors and cost advantages brought by technological progress and infrastructure improvements. It is noteworthy that the national strategic planning target in 2020 can hardly be achieved under China’s current policy system and market conditions. The results of sensitivity analysis reveal that the policy support and maximum market capacity show different decisive influences on the development trend of the entire automotive market. In addition, if China's relevant energy and environmental planning can be effectively implemented, the rapid expansion of NEVs will significantly reduce the environmental impact of vehicles."

To perform the examinations, real-time data for the parameters and solid Particle Number (PN) emissions were synchronously collected. The driving conditions were specifically chosen because, depending on the driving conditions, PN emissions from a city bus may change by an order of magnitude. A PN measurement system highly sensitive to engine transients and background emissions was specifically chosen, because the particle emission levels typically found in modern diesel engines are relatively low. The measurements indicated that while operating over a flat route, the PN emissions of the bus were maximized at full-load accelerations and minimized at a constant speed of 70km/h, which is the maximum speed. Because the combustion process in a diesel engine is relatively stable under constant speed driving conditions, the particle formation was minimized. During acceleration, however, the particle formation is accelerated due to well-known turbo-lag phenomena that limit the intake air flow rate. For these reasons, there is no simple linear correlation between the PN concentration and the engine operating parameters for driving conditions that involve both acceleration and constant speed driving. However, it was observed that there is a strong correlation between the cumulative PN emissions and cumulative brake engine energy (BEE). The R2 values of the linear regression lines were almost 1.0 when the acceleration and constant speed operating conditions of the bus were separately evaluated. Because a city bus operates under real-world conditions involving both accelerating and constant speed driving conditions, a real world PN emission factor was suggested as a function of the maximum, minimum PN emissions (#/kWh) of the bus and a traffic intensity factor."

In many geographical regions where ground PM2.5 monitoring is spatially sparse and unsuitable for environmental health inference, satellite remote sensing can potentially be used for estimating human exposure to PM2.5. However, retrieval of the aerosol optical depth (AOD) using the Dark Target (DT) algorithm is uncertain in many regions worldwide (e.g. western USA, the Middle East and central Asia) due to low signal-to-noise ratio as a result of high surface reflectivity in the spectral bands used by the algorithm. In this study we use the Deep Blue (DB) algorithm as well as a combined DB-DT algorithm for AOD retrievals. The AOD products are used to predict ground PM2.5 using mixed effects models and the daily calibration approach. Models for the two study areas (Israel and San Joaquin Valley, Central California) were developed independently and then compared to each other. Using the AODDB within a mixed effects model considerably improved PM2.5 prediction in high reflectance regions, revealing in both study areas enhanced model performance (in terms of both R2 and the root mean square prediction error), significant increase in the spatiotemporal availability of the AOD product, and improved PM2.5 prediction relative to using AODDT retrievals."

The situation in which the increasing production of solid wastes cannot be confined in the old existing Municipal Solid Waste landfill (settled in Genoa, Liguria Region, Italy) is used as a case study. Risk assessment for human health due to air, surface water, groundwater and soil contamination is performed in different scenarios for the old landfill and compared with alternative Waste-to-Energy management solutions that consider thermal treatment by gasification of the total waste or gasification of the dry fraction coupled with anaerobic digestion of the wet fraction, plus biogas combustion with or without sludge and bottom ash/slag disposal in the old landfill. Hazard Index (HI) and Cancer Risk (CR) in case of operating landfill and under the suspected situation of failure of the sealing system, were respectively 1.15 and 1.1∗10−7. Unacceptable HI were found due to groundwater contamination, while HI due to river pollution was slightly under the threshold. Vegetables ingestion was the most important pathway and ammonia the most responsible of toxic adverse effects. Fish ingestion and dermal contact with contaminated water were found to be the most important exposure pathways for carcinogenic risk, due mainly to BTEX. HI and CR in the supposed scenario of total waste gasification were respectively 9.4∗10−1 and 1.1∗10−5 while they were respectively 3.2∗10−1 and 6∗10−6 in case of gasification of the dry fraction. CR in both scenarios was over the threshold mainly due to dioxins, where milk and meat ingestion were found to be the highest risk pathways. Inhalation resulted as the highest not-carcinogenic risk exposure pathway, mainly due to NOx. Decision making was made by weighing up the different scenarios, and results suggested to definitively close the landfill and to eliminate gasification of the total waste as a possible waste treatment process."

abstract = "Rapid urbanization, which is closely related to economic growth, human health, and micro-climate, has resulted in a considerable amount of anthropogenic heat emissions. The lack of estimation data on long-term anthropogenic heat emissions is a great concern in climate and urban flux research. This study estimated the annual average anthropogenic heat fluxes (AHFs) in Beijing–Tianjin–Hebei region in China between 1995 and 2015 on the basis of multisource remote sensing images and ancillary data. Anthropogenic heat emissions from different sources (e.g., industries, buildings, transportation, and human metabolism) were also estimated to analyze the composition of AHFs. The spatiotemporal dynamics of long-term AHFs with high spatial resolution (500 m) were estimated by using a refined AHF model and then analyzed using trend and standard deviation ellipse analyses. Results showed that values in the region increased significantly from 0.15 W· m−2 in 1995 to 1.46 W· m−2 in 2015. Heat emissions from industries, transportation, buildings, and human metabolism accounted for 64.1%, 17.0%, 15.5%, and 3.4% of the total anthropogenic heat emissions, respectively. Industrial energy consumption was the dominant contributor to the anthropogenic heat emissions in the region. During this period, industrial heat emissions presented an unstable variation but showed a growing trend overall. Heat emissions from buildings increased steadily. Spatial distribution was extended with an increasing tendency of the difference between the maximum and the minimum and was generally dominated by the northeast–southwest directional pattern. The spatiotemporal distribution patterns and trends of AHFs could provide vital support on management decision in city planning and environmental monitoring."

abstract = "Introduction
The threat of elevated temperatures and more intense and prolonged heat waves coupled with urban heat islands presents a significant risk to human health. City planners and policymakers need tools that predict how overheating risk varies within a city under different climate change and mitigation scenarios. A key driver of determining overheating risk is exposure to local urban temperatures and the extent to which such exposure may be modified by built environments where the majority of people spend their time. Due to the dispersion of monitoring stations, techniques are needed to extrapolate from single point measurements and their modifying determinants. This research aims to compare nine GIS spatial interpolation techniques of estimating street-level temperature in a subtropical city. Methods: Taipei city, Taiwan, is located in a subtropical zone with one of the highest population densities in the world. Taipei experienced warmer winters and hotter summers in recent 10 years with average temperature from 16.4 to 30.1°C, and expected to rise from 0.8(RCP2.6) to 3.2(RCP8.5)°C in 2081-2100. In this study, data from the Taiwan Central Weather Bureau weather stations and the Taiwan Environmental Protection Administration air monitoring sites were used. Nine interpolation techniques were applied. These were validated by using records from two sources to cross-validate by comparing Standardised mean error and Standardised Root-Mean-Square error. Results: Kriging techniques have better prediction performance than four non-geostatistical interpolation techniques. The performance of OCK techniques indicated the built environment, such as the nearby village park area or home density, can be important modifiers of external temperature in cities. Discussion: Local urban climates are complex systems; selecting a robust interpolation technique that accounts for underlying drivers is essential for policymakers. This research provides the basis to further estimate overheating risk by estimating local outdoor street-level temperature and the modifying effects of the built environment."

abstract = "In this paper, a novel framework and methodology based on hidden semi-Markov models (HSMMs) for high PM2.5 concentration value prediction is presented. Due to lack of explicit time structure and its short-term memory of past history, a standard hidden Markov model (HMM) has limited power in modeling the temporal structures of the prediction problems. To overcome the limitations of HMMs in prediction, we develop the HSMMs by adding the temporal structures into the HMMs and use them to predict the concentration levels of PM2.5. As a model-driven statistical learning method, HSMM assumes that both data and a mathematical model are available. In contrast to other data-driven statistical prediction models such as neural networks, a mathematical functional mapping between the parameters and the selected input variables can be established in HSMMs. In the proposed framework, states of HSMMs are used to represent the PM2.5 concentration levels. The model parameters are estimated through modified forward–backward training algorithm. The re-estimation formulae for model parameters are derived. The trained HSMMs can be used to predict high PM2.5 concentration levels. The validation of the proposed framework and methodology is carried out in real world applications: prediction of high PM2.5 concentrations at O’Hare airport in Chicago. The results show that the HSMMs provide accurate predictions of high PM2.5 concentration levels for the next 24h."

Models used five large hourly background O3 data sets (2006–2015), and included temporal features describing the O3 formation dynamic. Bagging and stacking ensembles of such classifiers and their cost of learning were also evaluated. C5.0 and nnet classifiers achieved the best forecasting performance, even at imbalanced learning. Bagging ensembles outperformed stacking approaches, although with little accuracy improvement as compared to classifiers. The cost of learning evidenced similar performance results from reduced fractions of original data sets. The use of these models to forecast background O3 threshold exceedances are encouraged due to the performances obtained and to their easy reproducibility."

Non-compliance between the sustainable development principles and transportation infrastructure projects is changing the appearance of historic cities from livable and vibrant atmosphere into the car-oriented condition and cause environmental and social problems. There exist numerous studies on measuring the sustainability of transportation at the country, state, city, and even traffic zone levels, but few have addressed the sustainability of micro-scale projects. The objective of this study is to assess the sustainability of infrastructure projects on urban transportation systems and evaluate their compliance with principles of sustainable development. According to made intensive field visits, run expert interviews, and development master plans relevant to the case study, nine scenarios are proposed to improve the traffic situation of Azadi district in Isfahan city. Obviously, a slight change in the urban streets network, would have a significant effect on traffic performance in larger area, therefore, all the proposed scenarios are modeled in Trans Cad 5.0 software environment to determine their influence area (IA) as the study area. Ten quantitative indicators in three dimensions (environmental, social, and economic) pertinent to the urban transportation are selected based on review of the related literature and available data in Isfahan. The IA and all proposed scenarios are simulated and calibrated in AIMSUN 8.0 environment and the indicators are quantified in a direct and indirect manner through AIMSUN outputs. A composite sustainability index (CSI) is applied for integrating the effects of selected indicators based on their rankings given by the experts regarding to the goals of Isfahan vision in 2025. The results indicate that public transportation development projects are the most compliant scenarios with the principles of urban sustainable development and the best options for the future development in Azadi district. This proposed framework, would assist policy-makers and traffic engineers in other cities to evaluate the sustainability of urban transportation infrastructure projects."

Annual hourly observations for PM10 in Negeri Sembilan, Malaysia from January 2003 to December 2010 were selected for predicting PM10 concentration level. Eighty percent of the monitoring records were used for training and twenty percent were used for validation of the models. Three accuracy measures – Prediction Accuracy (PA), Coefficient of Determination (R2) and Index of Agreement (IA), as well as two error measures – Normalized Absolute Error (NAE) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) were used to evaluate the performance of the models. Results show that PCA models combined with MLR and PCA with FFBP improved MLR and FFBP models for all three days in advance of predicting PM10 concentration, with reduced errors by as much as 18.1% (PCA–MLR) and 17.68% (PCA–FFBP) for next day, 19.2% (PCA–MLR) and 22.1% (PCA–FFBP) for next two-day and 18.7% (PCA–MLR) and 22.79% (PCA–FFBP) for next three-day predictions.

As a result, extensive work into the development of hydrogen fueled FCVs is taking place. The aim of this paper is to highlight some of the research and development work which has occurred in the past five years on fuel cell vehicle technology, with a focus on economic and environmental concerns. It is observed that the current efforts are divided up into several parts. The performance, durability, and cost of fuel cell technology continue to be improved, and some fuel cells are currently ready to be mounted on vehicles and tested. Environmental and economic assessments of the entire hydrogen supply chain, including fuel cell end-use, are being carried out by groups of researchers around the world. It is currently believed that fuel cells need at least five more years of testing and improvement before large scale commercialization can begin. Economic and environmental analyses show that FCVs will likely be both economically competitive and environmentally benign. Indeed, the transition of the transportation sector to the use of hydrogen FCVs will represent one of the biggest steps toward the hydrogen economy."

This increase further leads to a rise in indoor environment temperature, reduction of thermal comfort, increase of cooling demand, and heat related morbidity and mortality especially among vulnerable people such as the elderlies and those living in poorly ventilated buildings. Thus, it is imperative for cities to be empowered with predictive tools during extreme heat waves in order to be able to provide emergency plans. For this purpose, it is utmost importance to develop specialized tools to predict the indoor conditions based on the outdoor conditions recorded at the weather stations. In order to develop a reliable warning system artificial neural network (ANN) and regression method were proposed and tested for an indoor air temperature forecasting application with respect to neighborhood parameters. To find the most practical approach, a cross comparison of the models was conducted by two different levels of simulation in order to present the capturing and prediction performance of the developed models. In general, the ANN model showed better accuracy in predicting the indoor dry-bulb temperature while it was more complicated in implementation."

In China, PM2.5 pollution constitutes an extreme environmental and social problem of widespread public concern. In this work we estimate ground-level PM2.5 from satellite-derived aerosol optical depth (AOD), topography data, meteorological data, and pollutant emission using an integrative technique. In particular, Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) analysis was combined with Bayesian Maximum Entropy (BME) theory to assess the spatiotemporal characteristics of PM2.5 exposure in a large region of China and generate informative PM2.5 space-time predictions (estimates). It was found that, due to its integrative character, the combined BME-GWR method offers certain improvements in the space-time prediction of PM2.5 concentrations over China compared to previous techniques. The combined BME-GWR technique generated realistic maps of space-time PM2.5 distribution, and its performance was superior to that of seven previous studies of satellite-derived PM2.5 concentrations in China in terms of prediction accuracy. The purely spatial GWR model can only be used at a fixed time, whereas the integrative BME-GWR approach accounts for cross space-time dependencies and can predict PM2.5 concentrations in the composite space-time domain. The 10-fold results of BME-GWR modeling (R2 = 0.883, RMSE = 11.39 μg/m3) demonstrated a high level of space-time PM2.5 prediction (estimation) accuracy over China, revealing a definite trend of severe PM2.5 levels from the northern coast toward inland China (Nov 2015–Feb 2016). Future work should focus on the addition of higher resolution AOD data, developing better satellite-based prediction models, and related air pollutants for space-time PM2.5 prediction purposes."

The study was carried out in three stages. Firstly, noise survey on different floors of high-rise buildings along free flow expressway was conducted using noise measuring equipment. Furthermore, C-weighted network was used in conjunction with A-weighted network to determine low frequency noise, which is perhaps less noticed for most survey. Secondly, the noise indicators change rule on vertical plane was explored. Combining change rule with frequency spectrum analysis, the acoustic amenity for high-rise buildings was carried out deeply and strictly. In the last stage, traffic noise prediction model for high-rise building along expressway was constructed with neural network. A point worth emphasizing is that the comparison between developed model, FHWA model and measurement shows that the proposed model fits well with measurement as compared to FHWA model at 5% significance level. The developed method could be used as a tool for acoustic amenity analysis and model building. It would be possible to provide reference for urban expressway and building design."

How China can reinvent its energy economy cost-effectively while still achieving its commitments was the focus of a three-year joint research project completed in September 2016. Overall, this analysis found that if China follows a pathway in which it aggressively adopts all cost-effective energy efficiency and CO2 emission reduction technologies while also aggressively moving away from fossil fuels to renewable and other non-fossil resources, it is possible to not only meet its Paris Agreement Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) commitments, but also to reduce its 2050 CO2 emissions to a level that is 42% below the country’s 2010 CO2 emissions. While numerous barriers exist that will need to be addressed through effective policies and programs in order to realize these potential energy use and emissions reductions, there are also significant local environmental (e.g., air quality), national and global environmental (e.g., mitigation of climate change), human health, and other unquantified benefits that will be realized if this pathway is pursued in China."

The regression-type modeling strategies explain the data in terms of: temperature, solar radiation, dew point temperature, and wind speed, by regressing present ozone values to their past values. The ozone time series are available at various time intervals, including hourly intervals, from August 2010 to March 2011. The results for MLR, ANN and GEP models are not overly good but those produced by NLP and ARIMA are promising for the establishing a forecasting capability."

In fact, observation of atmospheric composition variables has been an important activity of atmospheric research that has developed instrumental tools (advanced analytical techniques) and platforms (instrumented passenger aircrafts, ground-based in situ and remote sensing stations, earth observation satellite instruments) providing essential information on the composition of the atmosphere. The variability of the atmospheric system and the extreme complexity of the atmospheric cycles for short-lived gaseous and aerosol species have led to the development of complex models to interpret observations, test our theoretical understanding of atmospheric chemistry and predict future atmospheric composition. The validation of numerical models requires accurate information concerning the variability of atmospheric composition for targeted species via comparison with observations and measurements. In this paper, we provide an overview of recent advances in instrumentation and methodologies for measuring atmospheric composition changes from space, aircraft and the surface as well as recent improvements in laboratory techniques that permitted scientific advance in the field of atmospheric chemistry. Emphasis is given to the most promising and innovative technologies that will become operational in the near future to improve knowledge of atmospheric composition. Our current observation capacity, however, is not satisfactory to understand and predict future atmospheric composition changes, in relation to predicted climate warming. Based on the limitation of the current European observing system, we address the major gaps in a second part of the paper to explain why further developments in current observation strategies are still needed to strengthen and optimise an observing system not only capable of responding to the requirements of atmospheric services but also to newly open scientific questions."

The Pannonian Basin Experiment, under the umbrella of the Global Energy and Water Exchanges project of the World Climate Research Programme, aims to achieve a better understanding of the Earth System components and their interactions in the Pannonian Basin. The scientific basis of the PannEx supports research that can better translate and deliver relevant climate data, information and knowledge for societal decision making through the national hydro-meteorological and climate services, research institutes and universities. We outline the framework for the development of the PannEx in the light of international efforts to provide scientific support and involve international research community in integrated approach towards identifying and increasing adaptation capacity in the face of climate change in the Pannonian Basin. As such, PannEx dedicated observational and modeling efforts also strive to reach results with the global impact."

In this paper, we evaluated Shenzhen's annual carbon budget from 2000 to 2008 by measuring the presence of carbon sinks and carbon sources in the city. First, we used a coefficient approach based on factors such as land-use status and crop yield, to determine the number of carbon sinks in Shenzhen. Second, we identified urban carbon sources such as human respiration, industrial fossil-fuel consumption, cropland soil, livestock and transportation. We used a traffic-prediction tool, namely the four-step model, to determine traffic flow and the average speed of vehicles based on land-use types and the spatial distribution of road networks. Finally, we used the aforementioned methods to estimate the number of carbon sinks and carbon sources in Shenzhen from 2000 to 2008, along with its net carbon source. The results show that the number of carbon sinks decreased and the number of carbon sources increased in Shenzhen between 2000 and 2008. However, the net carbon source per million GDP decreased, which suggests that carbon-reduction efficiency improved during this period. Urban expansion and forest reduction were the major causes of the observed carbon-sink reduction. We identified transportation and industrial fossil-fuel consumption as Shenzhen's main carbon sources. The former produces high concentrations of CO2; the latter is related to the growth of secondary industries. In addition, the spatial distribution of the net carbon source from 2000 to 2008 indicated that Shenzhen's net carbon source increased both spatially and temporally during this period."

The objective of this study is to estimate daily PM10 (PM < 10 μm), fine (PM < 2.5 μm, PM2.5) and coarse particles (PM between 2.5 and 10 μm, PM2.5–10) at 1-km2 grid for 2013–2015 using a machine learning approach, the Random Forest (RF). Separate RF models were defined to: predict PM2.5 and PM2.5–10 concentrations in monitors where only PM10 data were available (stage 1); impute missing satellite Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) data using estimates from atmospheric ensemble models (stage 2); establish a relationship between measured PM and satellite, land use and meteorological parameters (stage 3); predict stage 3 model over each 1-km2 grid cell of Italy (stage 4); and improve stage 3 predictions by using small-scale predictors computed at the monitor locations or within a small buffer (stage 5). Our models were able to capture most of PM variability, with mean cross-validation (CV) R2 of 0.75 and 0.80 (stage 3) and 0.84 and 0.86 (stage 5) for PM10 and PM2.5, respectively. Model fitting was less optimal for PM2.5–10, in summer months and in southern Italy. Finally, predictions were equally good in capturing annual and daily PM variability, therefore they can be used as reliable exposure estimates for investigating long-term and short-term health effects."

Aerosols considered include sulfate, nitrate, ammonium, organic carbon, and black carbon. Consideration of the impacts of aerosols improves the simulated O3 concentrations in China; the averaged biases in simulated O3 concentrations in China are +9% and +33% with and without the impacts of aerosols, respectively. The impacts of heterogeneous reactions on O3 are simulated to exhibit large spatial and temporal variations, and those of aerosols through altering photolysis rates are simulated to be small. Accounting for hydrolysis of N2O5, irreversible absorption of NO2 and NO3 on wet aerosols, and the uptake of HO2 by aerosols, O3 concentrations are simulated to decrease by 8–12 ppbv in northern China and to increase by 3–6 ppbv in southern China in winter, and reductions in O3 of exceeding 6 ppbv are simulated in a large fraction of China in other seasons. With the assumed uptake coefficients in this work, the hydrolysis of N2O5 is simulated to have a dominant role in reducing O3 concentrations all over China, as a result of the large reductions in NOx in the lower to middle troposphere in the northern mid-latitudes. On the contrary, the absorption of NO2 and NO3 is found to increase O3 concentrations by 3–10 ppbv in eastern China in winter because of the increases in chemical production of O3 in the VOC-limited regions. The impact of aerosols on O3 concentration through heterogeneous reactions is characterized in this work by the ratio of change in O3 concentration to local PM2.5 level (ROP = Δ[O3]/[PM2.5]). The locations of maximum reductions in O3 are not necessarily the places of maximum aerosol concentrations; the annual mean values of ROP are calculated to be −0.14, –0.17, –0.27, and −0.16 ppbv (μg m−3)−1 over the heavily polluted regions of Beijing–Tianjin–Tanggu, Yangtze River Delta, Pearl River Delta, and Sichuan Basin, respectively.

We analyzed the applications with respect to: the adaptation process; the “precision differential” which we define as the variation generated in the model between the degree of spatial variation within the spatial distribution of ES and what the model captures; the stakeholders’ opinions on the usefulness of models. We propose a protocol for adapting ESTIMAP to the local conditions. We present the precision differential as a means of assessing how the type of model and level of model adaptation generate variation among model outputs. We then present the opinion of stakeholders; that in general considered the approach useful for stimulating discussion and supporting communication. Major constraints identified were the lack of spatial data with sufficient level of detail, and the level of expertise needed to set up and compute the models."

By analyzing spatiotemporal differences in the FESEWI values between 2009 and 2015 using system dynamics (SD) model, a prediction of the evolutionary trend for the ecological security of the forest from 2015 to 2030 was made. The results indicate that the overall forestry ecological security will continue the improvement that began in 2009 through to 2030. Whilst the warning index decreased slightly between 2009 and 2015, we predict that it will increase between 2016 and 2030. Regional differences were seen in the change characteristics of FESEWI values over time within the period studied. Spatially, the early warning index demonstrated an upward trend from the Functional Expansion Zone to New Urban Development Zone followed by Ecological Conservation Zone, and the low index range increasingly expanded with urbanization. The spatiotemporal evolution features of forest ecological security in Beijing were significantly affected by many factors, including forestry resources, socioeconomic activities, natural environment, and forestry policy, which resulted in periodicity and regional differences in the evolution of forest ecological security values."

abstract = "In general, car manufacturers face trade-offs between safety, efficiency and environmental performance when choosing between mass, length, engine power, and fuel efficiency. Moreover, the information available to the consumers makes difficult to assess all these components at once, especially when aiming to compare vehicles across different categories and/or to compare vehicles in the same category but across different model years. The main objective of this research was to develop an integrated tool able to assess vehicle’s performance simultaneously for safety and environmental domains, leading to the research output of a Safety, Fuel Efficiency and Green Emissions (SEG) indicator able to evaluate and rank vehicle’s performance across those three domains. For this purpose, crash data was gathered in Porto (Portugal) for the period 2006–2010 (N=1374). The crash database was analyzed and crash severity prediction models were developed using advanced logistic regression models. Following, the methodology for the SEG indicator was established combining the vehicle’s safety and the environmental evaluation into an integrated analysis. The obtained results for the SEG indicator do not show any trade-off between vehicle’s safety, fuel consumption and emissions. The best performance was achieved for newer gasoline passenger vehicles (<5year) with a smaller engine size (<1400cm3). According to the SEG indicator, a vehicle with these characteristics can be recommended for a safety-conscious profile user, as well as for a user more interested in fuel economy and/or in green performance. On the other hand, for larger engine size vehicles (>2000cm3) the combined score for safety user profile was in average more satisfactory than for vehicles in the smaller engine size group (<1400cm3), which suggests that in general, larger vehicles may offer extra protection. The achieved results demonstrate that the developed SEG integrated methodology can be a helpful tool for consumers to evaluate their vehicle selection through different domains (safety, fuel efficiency and green emissions). Furthermore, SEG indicator allows the comparison of vehicles across different categories and vehicle model years. Hence, this research is intended to support the decision-making process for transportation policy, safety and sustainable mobility, providing insights not only to policy makers, but also for general public guidance."

Global climate change is evident in many parts of the world, which affects especially droughts, floods, and flash floods in addition to agricultural products and many human activities in an unusual manner. In the past, natural climate changes have forced many societies to migrate from arid and drought (water stricken) locations for better living conditions because every culture and civilization has to depend on and adapt to environmental conditions, among which the most significant factors are pleasant effects of weather and atmospheric conditions in terms of climate, hydrological cycle, and water resources. This chapter provides basic information about climate change and its possible impact on sustainable human development. A detailed account on the atmospheric chemistry composition and about its slight change due to anthropogenic activities is presented with simple explanations. A simple model for 1°C global warming increment is explained, as a result of which the climate belts are bound to shift toward the polar regions by 250–300km. The manner in which one can adapt to climate is presented in step-by-step detail. Drought disasters and desertification coupled with climate change and their impacts on water resources are given through factual data from the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) and Turkey. The climate change preparation task faced by metropolitan cities is explained with applications from Istanbul City, Turkey. The basic concepts in any climate model structure are explained with appropriate downscaling procedures and applications for Riyadh city, KSA, and Istanbul City, Turkey. Among the adaptation procedures, groundwater recharge and rainfall harvesting are suggested in addition to balanced and optimum management of available water resources."

Thus, this study developed a new model, entitled “DECA”, which includes individually measured parameters and the washing of vegetables before human consumption. Results given by DECA and HHRAP models were compared with experimental measurements of lettuce. The data calculated by the DECA model were highly correlated with the measured values; the HHRAP model overestimates foliar lead uptake.

In order to identify appropriate strategies to control GLO levels, accurate assessment and prediction is essential, for which elaborate simulation and modelling is required. Several studies have been undertaken in the past to simulate GLO levels at different scales and for various applications. It is important to evaluate these studies, widely spread over in literature. This paper aims to critically review various studies that have been undertaken, especially in the past 15 years (2000–15) to model GLO. The review has been done of the studies that range over different spatial scales – urban to regional and continental to global. It also includes a review of performance evaluation and sensitivity analysis of photo-chemical transport models in order to assess the extent of application of these models and their predictive capability. The review indicates following major findings: (a) models tend to over-estimate the night-time GLO concentrations due to limited titration of GLO with NO within the model; (b) dominance of contribution from far-off regional sources to average ozone concentration in the urban region and higher contribution of local sources during days of high ozone episodes; requiring strategies for controlling precursor emissions at both regional and local scales; (c) greater influence of NOx over VOC in export of ozone from urban regions due to shifting of urban plumes from VOC-sensitive regime to NOx-sensitive as they move out from city centres to neighbouring rural regions; (d) models with finer resolution inputs perform better to a certain extent, however, further improvement in resolutions (beyond 10 km) did not show improvement always; (e) future projections show an increase in GLO concentrations mainly due to rise in temperatures and biogenic VOC emissions."

However, research on the health effects of PM2.5 in China has been hindered by the lack of high-quality exposure estimates. In this study, we assessed the excess mortality associated with both short- and long-term exposure to ambient PM2.5 simultaneously using satellite-derived exposure data at a high spatiotemporal resolution. Adult registries of non-accidental, respiratory and cardiovascular deaths in urban Beijing in 2013 were collected. Exposure levels were estimated from daily satellite-based PM2.5 concentrations at 1 km spatial resolution from 2004 to 2013. Mixed Poisson regression models were fitted to estimate the cause-specific mortality in association with PM2.5 exposures. With the mutual adjustment of short- and long-term exposure of PM2.5, the percent increases associated with every 10 μg/m3 increase in short-term PM2.5 exposure were 0.09% (95% CI: −0.14%, 0.33%; lag 01), 1.02% (95% CI: 0.08%, 1.97%; lag 04) and 0.09% (95% CI: −0.23%, 0.42%; lag 01) for non-accidental, respiratory and cardiovascular mortality, respectively; those attributable to every 10 μg/m3 increase in long-term PM2.5 exposure (9-year moving average) were 16.78% (95% CI: 10.58%, 23.33%), 44.14% (95% CI: 20.73%, 72.10%) and 3.72% (95% CI: −3.75%, 11.77%), respectively. Both associations of short- and long-term exposure with the cause-specific mortality decreased after they were mutually adjusted. Associations between short-term exposure to satellite-based PM2.5 and cause-specific mortality were larger than those estimated using fixed measurements. Satellite-based PM2.5 predictions help to improve the spatiotemporal resolution of exposure assessments and the mutual adjustment model provide better estimation of PM2.5 associated health effects. Effects attributable to long-term exposure of PM2.5 were larger than those of short-term exposure, which should be more concerned for public health."

For this purpose of evaluation the truncated (up to ∼16 km or 10 miles) and discrete (at the interval no less than 0.4 km or 1/4 mile) visibility data from hourly operational weather reports are not suitable, and the ASOS-measured one-minute raw surface extinction coefficient (bext) values have to be used. Consequently, a method for quality control on the bext data is first developed to eliminate frequent problems such as extraneous points, poor calibration, and bad formatting, after which reliable bext data are obtained to estimate the surface visibility. Subsequent analysis of the AOD and bext relationship on the East Coast of the United States reveals their average linear correlation coefficient (R) of 0.61 for all twelve (2000–2011) years of data at 32 ASOS stations, with the highest R value in summer and the lowest values in fall and winter. Incorporation of the Goddard Earth Observing System, Version 5 (GEOS-5) modeled vertical profile of aerosols into the derivation of visibility from AOD is evaluated for two methods, one scaling the modeled surface bext with the ratio of MODIS AOD to the modeled AOD, and another scaling the ratio of modeled AOD in the boundary layer to total columnar AOD with the MODIS AOD and assuming well-mixed aerosol extinction in the boundary layer. Analysis with three summers (2003–2004, 2006) of available GEOS-5 data and ASOS data reveals that the second method is superior, and generates a regression model that, after independent evaluation for summer 2005, is found to be statistically robust with R of 0.70 and a mean bias of 0.32 km in derived visibility. This study is among the first to demonstrate the potential of using satellite-based aerosol product over land to operationally derive surface visibility."

The extent and magnitude of acid deposition in Asia became apparent only about one decade after this issue was well described in Europe and North America. In addition to the temperate zone, much of eastern and southern Asia is situated in the tropics and subtropics, climate zones hitherto little studied with respect to the effects of high loads of acid deposition. Surface waters across Asia are generally not sensitive to the effects of acid deposition, whereas soils in some regions are sensitive to acidification due to low mineral weathering. However, soil acidification was largely neutralized by such processes as base cation deposition, nitrate (NO3−) denitrification, and sulfate (SO42−) adsorption. Accompanying the decrease in S deposition in recent years, N deposition is of increasing concern in Asia. The acidifying effect of N deposition may be more important than S deposition in well drained tropical/subtropical soils due to high SO42− adsorption. The risk of regional soil acidification is a major threat in Eastern Asia, indicated by critical load exceedance in large areas."

We also diagnosed and identified the impact of meteorological conditions on air quality (AQ). The results show that the condensation function fc is a sensitive and significant parameter for PM2.5 concentration, favourable for generation of secondary aerosol particles. Statistical analysis of a large sample of PM2.5 and meteorological observation data indicates that adaptive weight parameter β is of great value in diagnosing changes in PM2.5 concentrations. When Beijing and North China experience dry, cold winters with a low fc, the parameter β will be large, creating conditions that are conducive to suspended fine particles. In moist, hot summers, the high temperature and humidity increase the fc, but β plays a much weaker role than in winter. β and fc influence and restrict each other, and their impacts on the changes in PM2.5 concentrations are consistent with the observed seasonal changes in meteorological elements and PM2.5 concentrations. In addition, a good correlation exists between the 24-h forecast of the I index and the PM2.5 observations in Beijing, which will prove useful in diagnosing, identifying and predicting the influence of meteorological conditions on AQ based on PM2.5 concentrations."

abstract = "Urban and road planners must take right decisions related to urban traffic management and controlling noise pollution. Their assessments and resolutions have important consequences on the annoyance of population exposed to road-traffic-noise and controlling other environmental pollutants (e.g. NOx or ultrafine particles emitted by heavy vehicles). One of the key decisions is the selection of which noise control actions should be taken in sensitive areas (residential or hospital areas, school areas etc), that could include costly measures such as reducing the overall traffic, banning or reducing traffic of heavy vehicles, inspection of motorbikes sound emission, etc. For an efficient decision-making in noise control actions, it is critical to classify a given location in a sensitive area according to the different prevailing traffic conditions. This paper outlines an expert system aimed to help urban planners to classify urban locations based on their traffic composition. To induce knowledge into the system, several machine learning algorithms are used, based on multi-layer Perceptron and support vector machines with sequential minimal optimization. As input variables for these algorithms, a combination of environment variables was used. For the development of the classification models, four feature selection techniques, i.e., two subset evaluation (correlation-based feature-subset selection and consistency-based subset evaluation) and two attribute evaluation (ReliefF and minimum redundancy maximum relevance) were implemented to reduce the models’ complexity. The overall procedure was tested on a full database collected in the city of Granada (Spain), which includes urban locations with road-traffic as dominant noise source. Among all the possibilities tested, support vector machines based models achieves the better results in classifying the considered urban locations into the 4 categories observed, with values of average weighted F-measure and Kappa statistics (used as indicators) up to 0.9 and 0.8. Regarding the feature selection techniques, attribute evaluation algorithms (ReliefF and mRMR) achieve better classification results than subset evaluation algorithms in reducing the model complexity, and so relevant environmental variables are chosen for the proposed procedure. Results show that these tools can be used for addressing a prompt assessment of potential road-traffic-noise related problems, as well as for gathering information in order to take more well-founded actions against urban road-traffic noise."

The case studies are based on research where environmental media-specific levels of Pb were determined as part of the epidemiological and statistical designs. The first case study summarizes exposure characterizations of individuals living in a well-known and studied, geographically broad locale impacted by a Pb point source in Idaho that had long released Pb to the environment. The second case study examines a series of site-specific exposure assessments pooled to produce predictive relationships of PbB in children three years of age or younger to such lead sources as dusts and soils. This second illustration presents exposure characterizations for specific locations that were of two general site types: urban lead exposure settings in old city neighborhoods with lead paint and industrial emission histories, and Pb exposure endpoints reported for mining and other extractive industry sites. The third case study presents results of case studies of U.S. populations selected by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) as part of regulatory action for air Pb."

abstract = "In recent years, the forecasting of particles with a diameter of 2.5 μm or less (PM2.5) has been a popular research topic, and involves multiple sources of pollution, making it difficult to determine all of the contributing meteorological and environmental factors. When only the PM2.5 concentration time series is considered without other exogenous information, accurate forecasting is important and should be efficient. To address this problem, this paper proposes a hybrid algorithm consisting of multiple models to improve prediction accuracy. The innovation of the proposed hybrid algorithm is to decompose the original single one-dimensional (1D) PM2.5 data into multi-dimensional information which effectively mines information hidden in the 1D data. Then, it uses traditional prediction methods to forecast each sequence and to reconstruct its forecasting results to obtain the final forecasting results. Three hybrid models, Wavelet-ANN, Wavelet-ARIMA and Wavelet-SVM, are developed to forecast the 2016 PM2.5 trends in 5 Cities in China. The results showed that: (1) Hybrid models (Wavelet-ANN, Wavelet-ARIMA and Wavelet-SVM) can forecast short-term PM2.5 concentrations in China. Compared with the traditional Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA), Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) models, hybrid models can significantly improve prediction accuracy. (2) The Wavelet-ARIMA model has higher accuracy with respect to predicting PM2.5 concentrations. In particular, it can more accurately capture the mutational points of PM2.5 concentrations, which can provide effective information support for generating warnings about atmospheric pollution. The hybrid algorithm proposed in this paper can be effectively applied to the short-term forecasting of PM2.5 concentrations and can significantly improve the accuracy of prediction."

In each of three residential sites, seven permanent quadrats (10 × 10 m) were selected for investigating the phenological behavior of P. dioscoridis, while an additional three quadrats were sampled for soil and plant analysis during March to November 2015. The flowering time of P. dioscoridis covers 7 months, with a peak in July. The above- and below-ground biomass attained their highest values in July. Concentrations of macro-nutrients in the shoot were significantly higher than in the root. However, concentrations of most heavy metals were significantly higher in the roots than in the shoots. The regression equations based on plant size index, as a predictor variable, was the best equation for different shoot compartments, while that based on plant diameter was the best equation for root biomass estimation. Based on the results of the bio-accumulation and translocation factors, P. dioscoridis can phytostabilize Cu, Pb, Cd, and Zn and can be used in a phytoextraction strategy for Cr. The significant positive correlations between Cd and Cr in soil with those in P. dioscoridis tissues suggest its potential use as a bioindicator and biomonitor for Cd and Cr pollution."

These artificial neural networks (ANNs) with different architectures are trained using the Levenberg–Marquardt (LM) back-propagation algorithm and a cross validation is also performed to ensure that the results generalise to other unseen datasets. A rigorous study is carried out on optimally choosing the number of hidden layers, number of neurons in the hidden layer and activation function in a network using multiple Monte Carlo runs. Nine input and three output parameters are used to train and test various neural network architectures in both multiple output and single output prediction paradigms using the available experimental datasets.

abstract = "Background
Current epidemiologic studies rely on simple ozone metrics which may not appropriately capture population ozone exposure. For understanding health effects of long-term ozone exposure in population studies, it is advantageous for exposure estimation to incorporate the complex spatiotemporal pattern of ozone concentrations at fine scales.
Objective
To develop a geo-statistical exposure prediction model that predicts fine scale spatiotemporal variations of ambient ozone in six United States metropolitan regions.
Methods
We developed a modeling framework that estimates temporal trends from regulatory agency and cohort-specific monitoring data from MESA Air measurement campaigns and incorporates land use regression with universal kriging using predictor variables from a large geographic database. The cohort-specific data were measured at home and community locations. The framework was applied in estimating two-week average ozone concentrations from 1999 to 2013 in models of each of the six MESA Air metropolitan regions.
Results
Ozone models perform well in both spatial and temporal dimensions at the agency monitoring sites in terms of prediction accuracy. City-specific leave-one (site)-out cross-validation R2 accounting for temporal and spatial variability ranged from 0.65 to 0.88 in the six regions. For predictions at the home sites, the R2 is between 0.60 and 0.91 for cross-validation that left out 10% of home sites in turn. The predicted ozone concentrations vary substantially over space and time in all the metropolitan regions.
Conclusion
Using the available data, our spatiotemporal models are able to accurately predict long-term ozone concentrations at fine spatial scales in multiple regions. The model predictions will allow for investigation of the long-term health effects of ambient ozone concentrations in future epidemiological studies."

Nighttime light data from NOAA was used in place of gross domestic product (GDP) in a robustness test. From a global analysis perspective, the EKC is established, and the inflection point is approximately 40000 yuan per capita; however, the GWR estimate is better than the ordinary least squares (OLS) estimate with an improvement in R2 from 0.20 to 0.75. The GWR estimation results show that different environmental protection inputs have different effects in different regions: 1. Technical inputs tend to increase productivity rather than reduce emissions in most areas except Guangdong and Jiangsu. 2. The industrial output values in Guangxi and Yunnan have a greater impact on pollution than those in other regions. 3. In the central and eastern regions with dense populations, comprehensive public transportation can effectively reduce haze pollution. In terms of environmental protection measures, park green areas can reduce pollution, and due to the current status of industrial waste recovery in China, increasing the recovery rate of industrial waste is not conducive to reducing pollution.

abstract = "A severe PM10 episode was observed at the high elevation observatory of Mt. Cimone (2165 m a.s.l.) in the period of 13th-15th March 2004; during the event PM10 reached the maximum concentration (80 μg m−3 against an average of 8.8 ± 8.0 μg m−3) between 1998 and 2011. Meteo-synoptical analysis allowed to ascribe this event to a long lasting and highly coherent Saharan dust outbreak, starting at the beginning of March. The peculiar synoptic configuration causing this massive transport of dust was characterized by a steep gradient between an upper level trough extending to low latitudes with a minimum centred over the North-Western Algerian coast and a Saharan high extending all over the Mediterranean Sea with an elongated north-eastward tongue, whose synergic effect led to a peculiar funnel-shaped dust plume. During the period Mt. Cimone was located exactly along its main axis. The event was first analysed in association with simultaneous more or less conventional compositional parameters such as 7Be, 210Pb, and ozone. Subsequently, it was characterized in details both in terms of time and space evolution. The former aspect was investigated using number densities of fine and coarse particles obtained through an Optical Particle Counter which allowed to follow the event evolution at the sub-daily time scale while PM10 membrane gravimetric analysis was limited by the 48-h sampling schedule suggesting the value of 80 μg m−3 recorded is even potentially smoothed down by sampling duration. Besides precise timing, optical counting enabled to detect the inception and development of the event through a steep and simultaneous increase of both coarse and fine particle number densities. Although the former increase was much more relevant, the latter occurrence is much less frequently documented for Saharan Dust events: a clear increase of particles in all the diameter ranges from 0.3 μm (lower limit of an OPC) up to 5.0 μm was observed during the event. The spatial extension of the event was also examined by means of the analysis of the AERONET ground-based sun photometer data from the Venice station for the event. Results confirmed a relevant increase of coarse particles over a distance of more than 150 km. Interestingly AERONET data indicates a more significant variation in the scattering properties of the aerosol rather than in the absorbing ones in connection with the arrival of the Saharan dust, an observation that within the intrinsic limitations of inverse methods to derive aerosol's optical properties is in agreement with some previous observations showing that dust in the Saharan desert region is much less absorbing than previously measured."

Despite this, several algorithms are present in literature leaving to the reader a choice on the best approach without considering the physical – spatial – temporal inconsistencies concerning the problem of relating satellite with ground-based data. In order to overcome this dilemma, the present work was carried out developing a general methodological approach to overcome the aforementioned inconsistencies obtaining in any region the best retrieval. In this respect, the particulate matter phenomenology (both at ground and vertically) was considered in order to select the best approach for the AOD to PM conversion starting from the knowledge of PM properties, meteorology and vertical behaviour. In this respect, multiple years of particulate matter vertical profiles, chemical composition, hygroscopicity, meteorology and optical properties were used to define an optimized satellite AOD-ground PM relationship. A hybrid algorithm (physically based and statistical) was developed to be applied over the Milan conurbation (Po Valley) to determine ground-level PM1, PM2.5 and PM10 concentrations from satellite aerosol optical depth (AOD) data. The developed algorithm (based on aerosol optical depth, mixing height, wind speed and PM concentrations of the previous day) showed high accuracy enabling to predict ground particulate matter concentrations with very low RMSE in prediction (5.48 μg/m3, 9.89 μg/m3 and 10.64 μg/m3 for PM1, PM2.5 and PM10) and rather high R2 (≥0.83 on the evaluation set of data)."

This review assesses the state of the scientific knowledge on how the frequency, location and severity of such events are likely to change up to 2060 due to climate change, together with the robustness of that knowledge (particularly with respect to the underlying climate modeling). The evidence indicates robust global increases in the frequency and magnitude of high temperature extremes together with more frequent and intense heavy precipitation events in many, but by no means all, regions. The projected changes in precipitation imply an increase in the risk of river floods, but rather few projections of river discharge and the associated flood risk are available. Projections indicate an increase in intense tropical cyclone activity, but overall a decrease or little change in the total number of cyclones. A number of gaps in knowledge are identified, particularly with respect to compound or combined extreme events (such as storm surge associated with river flooding) and sequences of events (such as successive flooding/drought) which may be most important in terms of impacts."

Cloud Computing has emerged as a new paradigm to provide computing as a utility service for addressing different processing needs with a) on demand services, b) pooled resources, c) elasticity, d) broad band access and e) measured services. The utility of delivering computing capability fosters a potential solution for the transformation of Big Data's 4 Vs into the 5th (value). This paper investigates how Cloud Computing can be utilized to address Big Data challenges to enable such transformation. We introduce and review four geospatial scientific examples, including climate studies, geospatial knowledge mining, land cover simulation, and dust storm modelling. The method is presented in a tabular framework as a guidance to leverage Cloud Computing for Big Data solutions. It is demostrated throught the four examples that the framework method supports the life cycle of Big Data processing, including management, access, mining analytics, simulation and forecasting.

This is done through scenario analysis which would also cater for uncertainty in planning. Good energy plan would ensure sustainable development which acts as a guiding factor for any energy scheme. In this paper, we present an overview of the different facets of energy planning based on a comprehensive literature review.

The dynamics of the time series is often studied at one temporal scale. It is assumed that if the time series is determined to be chaotic at one temporal scale, its behavior at another scale can be determined as the scale shifts are allowed due to scale invariance property. The actual dynamics at other scales is however not yet analyzed. The assumption of scale invariance of the time series at different time scales is tested in this study. The analysis is carried out for ground ozone levels observed during 2006 at two sites of different land use characteristics, as traffic and mixed-use in Delhi at four temporal scales as 1h, 4h, 8h and 24h. The chaotic nature is observed for the ozone concentration with 1h and 4h frequency, whereas at 8h and 24h time scale, the ozone concentration shows random behavior. As expected, a decrease in the variability is observed in the ozone levels with increase in the scales from 1h to 24h. The results indicated the temporal scale shifts are allowed from 1h to 4h resolution and vice versa. The ozone time series at 8h and 24h scalings however, should be dealt separately. Further analysis for corresponding NO2 concentration at two sites suggested finite d2 for 1h, 4h and 8h scalings with higher value at traffic site than that at mixed-use site. The analysis also indicated same degrees of freedom for ozone and NO2 concentration at traffic site whereas at mixed-use site the number of variables governing the NO2 pollution are less than the ozone concentration."

Historically, San Antonio has been the gateway to Mexico and is strategically located along the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) corridor. It is also characterized by some of the most distinct residential segregation among U.S. cities. However, little is understood about the ways in which historically institutionalized residential segregation initiated by the Home Owners' Loan Corporation (HOLC) and NAFTA have affected socio-ecological outcomes. Here, this paper presents a novel empirical study of racial residential segregation. The study utilizes quantitative and spatially explicit estimates of regulating ecosystem services and biodiversity, and links the supply of ecosystem services to the distribution of human well-being within a heterogeneous social-ecological system. Specifically, the paper employed 1930s HOLC redlining maps and applied the ceteris paribus approach for racial concentrations to reflect a historical legacy and path dependence by institutional inertia. The results point to the social-ecological divide in that Hispanic and African American minorities derive fewer ecosystem benefits and face greater health risks and socio-economic disadvantages (p < 0.01). Notably, NAFTA corridor-related health risks are the most significant for the Hispanic population (p < 0.01). These patterns are likely to persist and may be amplified by 2050 (adjusted R2 = 0.646). The findings highlight that institutional transformations are essential for the greater social-ecological equity in the San Antonio region under NAFTA and, potentially, new United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement. Additionally, by assessing the EJ implications of spatially heterogeneous distribution of ecosystem services supply, the paper provides methodology that enhances science-based planning and better environmental decision-making to avoid or mitigate social-ecological divides in rapidly urbanizing regions both in the U.S. and around the world."

The city is the hub of modern human life and the urban transport sector is developing fast. Specifically, in the Internet era, the development of public transport has brought new challenges and opportunities to urban passenger transport. Thus, research on the energy demand and environmental emissions of the urban transport sector is significant and timely. This paper takes Beijing’s public transport as an example and applies the Long-range Energy Alternatives Planning (LEAP) model to analyze the energy demand and the main greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions under different scenarios during the period 2016–2030. The results show that: 1) if the government fails to guide the development of passenger transport appropriately, its energy demand and GHG emissions will rise rapidly and under the baseline scenario, the energy demand and emissions in 2030 are about 1.8 times those oft 2015; 2) the scenarios of developing public transport and transport sharing have a significant effect of energy saving and emission reduction and in 2030 the energy demand and GHG emissions falls by 25%–30% compared with that of the baseline scenario, so the combination of public transport and transport sharing is a wise choice for the low carbon development of the passenger transport sector in Beijing; 3) scenarios of easing road congestion and new-energy and clean-energy vehicle development have huge potential for energy saving and emission reduction, particularly the internal adjustment of the energy structure in the scenario of developing new-energy and clean-energy vehicles, which can greatly reduce the demand for traditional energy sources and reduce GHG emissions. This paper illustrates the development trends of energy demand and GHG emissions in Beijing’s passenger transport sector under the scenarios of transport sharing development and traditional development in the Internet era, providing a basis for decision making."

This can result in adverse health effects such as respiratory illness and cardiovascular diseases. However, accurately characterizing the UFP number concentration requires expensive sets of instruments. The development of an UFP surrogate with cheap and convenient measures is needed. In this study, we used a mobile measurement platform with a Fast Mobility Particle Sizer (FMPS) and sound level meter to investigate the spatiotemporal relations of noise and UFP and identify the hotspots of UFP. UFP concentration levels were significantly influenced by temporal and spatial variations (p < 0.001). We proposed a Generalized Additive Models to predict UFP number concentration in the study area. The model uses noise and meteorological covariates to predict the UFP number concentrations at an industrial site in Taichung, Taiwan. During the one year sampling campaign from fall 2013 to summer 2014, mobile measurements were performed at least one week for each season, both on weekdays and weekends. The proposed model can explain 80% of deviance and has coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.77. Moreover, the developed UFP model was able to adequately predict UFP concentrations, and can provide people with a convenient way to determine UFP levels. Finally, the results from this study could help facilitate the future development of noise mobile measurement."

The results show that there are obvious differences in the removal of PM by different intensity precipitation processes. Drizzle shows a negative removal effect on PM2.5 with an efficiency between −16.5% and −36.5%, while a positive removal effect is found for PMCourse (diameters between 2.5 and 10 μm), and the efficiency varies from 31.7% to 38.4%.The removal effects of other precipitation events (intensity ≥ light rain) are positive for both PM2.5 and PMCourse, and the efficiency is 19.1–68.5% and 31.7–86.3%, respectively. Generally, the effective removal durations for PM2.5 and PMCourse are 2–9 and 2–10 h, respectively, and the removal effect becomes better as the PM diameters increase. Moreover, the strongest removal effect of precipitation on PM2.5 occurs in autumn while that for PMCourse occurs in spring, and nighttime precipitation has higher removal efficiency and longer removal duration than daytime precipitation. Additionally, a longer duration of precipitation results in a higher removal efficiency for PM with large diameters and a longer duration for effective removal."

Simultaneous measurements of UFP and gaseous pollutants were carried out during one month at three sampling locations situated within a 1 km2 area in a Belgian city, Antwerp. The method proposed provides accurate predictions when using NO and NO2 as covariates and less accurate predictions when using CO and O3.

However, there is a lack of existing literature on the Western Balkan region, with no evidence of whether the impact of urban green spaces on health depends on the type and average amount of green space available. This paper examines the connection between the perceived benefits of urban green areas and the physical and mental well-being of visitors in two central municipalities of the city of Belgrade (Serbia). For this purpose the survey was conducted on two hundred residents of the municipalities of Vračar and Čukarica. The object of the survey was to explore whether residents who live in areas with more green spaces perceive better physical and mental health and spend more time outdoors. A t-test for independent samples showed that the respondents who value recreational activities like walking and common activities perceive more social benefits of a green space. The results indicate that urban green areas are recognised as suitable settings for running and jogging, but also refer to their potential for the alleviation of self-reported nervous problems and medication use, therefore supporting further research on this topic."

It is sufficiently simple and easily applicable in operational forecasting systems with the ability to accept as inputs both historical data and exogenous paraeters, such as meteorological variables. The application of the proposed methodology is demonstrated using data from five monitoring stations of air pollutants located in Athens, over a five year period (2000–2004) as well as compatible meteorological data from the NCEP (National Centers for Environmental Protection). A set of different models have been tested at the same time to reveal the effectiveness of the proposed approach, both univariate and multivariate, and linear and non-linear models. The analysis of all examined datasets has shown conclusive evidence that the introduction of the newly developed procedure which utilises data collected over a shorter horizon can significantly increase the forecasting ability of any developed model using daily historic PM10 data, under all examined metrics."

abstract = "Several statistical methods are performed in this study to evaluate the effect of emission control measures on particulate matter (PM) concentrations during the 2014 Asia–Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Summit held in Beijing. The concentration of PM2.5 is reduced by 30%, 38% on a year-on-year and month-on-month basis during the APEC emission control period while PM10 reducing by 41% and 26% respectively. Considering from the impacts of the weather circulation types, PM2.5 and PM10 are both reduced by 34%. ANN model is considered to be appropriate with the ability of characterising non-linear phenomena. In this work an ANN model is built to predict the daily averaged PM concentrations. Comparing the observed PM concentrations and the predicted value which are forecasted by ANN model on condition that no emission control measures were carried out during the APEC, the reductions for PM2.5 and PM10 are 24%, 28% respectively. All these results suggest that strict emission control measures push down the pollution level effectively, and more observed data with long time could improve the accuracy of evaluation results. More stringent controls of regional emissions should be lasted for the continuous improvements of air quality in Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region."

abstract = "This paper reviews the global status of waste to energy (WTE) technologies as a mean for renewable energy production and municipal solid waste (MSW) disposal method. A case study of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) under this concept was developed. The WTE opportunities in the KSA is undertaken in the context of two scenarios: (1) incineration and (2) refuse derived fuel (RDF) along with biomethanation from 2012 to 2035. Biomethanation technology can proved to be the most suitable WTE technology for KSA due to (a) availability of high food waste volume (37% of total MSW) that can be used as a feedstock, (b) higher efficiency (25–30%) and (c) lowest annual capital ($0.1–0.14/ton) and operational cost. However, the need for large space for continuous operation might increase operational cost. The RDF has an advantage over incineration due to (a) less annual capital ($7.5–11.3/ton) and (b) operational cost ($0.3–0.55/ton), but the high labor skills requirements will most probably be a limitation, if appropriate training and related infrastructure are not scheduled to be included as a prerequisite. The incineration technology also proves to be an efficient solution with a relatively higher efficiency (25%) and lower operational cost ($1.5–2.5/ton). However, the need for treatment of air and waterborne pollutants and ash within the incineration facility can be the limiting factors for the development of this technology in KSA. In 2012, the power generation potential for KSA was estimated at 671MW and 319.4MW from incineration and RDF with biomethanation scenarios respectively, which was forecasted to reach upto 1447MW and 699.76MW for both scenarios respectively by 2035. Therefore, WTE technologies, could make a substantial contribution to the renewable energy production in KSA as well as alleviating the cost of landfilling and its associated environmental impacts. However, the decision to select between the two scenarios requires further in-depth financial, technical and environmental analysis using life cycle assessment (LCA) tool."

In the present study, we assessed the impact of daily temperature range on upper and lower respiratory infections in Cordoba, Argentina, and explored the effect modification of socio-economic factors and influence of airborne particles We found that temperature range is a strong risk factor for admissions due to both upper and lower respiratory infections, particularly in elderly individuals, and that these effects are more pronounced in sub-populations with low education level or in poor living conditions. These results indicate that socio-economic factors are strong modifiers of the association between temperature variability and respiratory morbidity, thus they should be considered in risk assessments."

This chapter examines climate futures in the context of Earth system (ES) study. The notion of Earth as a living, integrated system is not new. The future climate is just one component of a larger, complex system including people and their practices as well as the physical and bio-geochemical aspects of the Earth. This chapter places the future climate in a “bigger picture” that has many names including Gaia and Earth system science. It recognizes that climate has been used frequently as a way of illustrating emergent Earth system behavior and so, it explores how future climates are integral to this whole-of-Earth system. The need for science and technology to underpin sustainable development in the Anthropocene was acknowledged at the World Summit on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg in 2002. Exploring options for promoting efforts towards sustainable ES management was, therefore, the central goal of the 91st Dahlem Workshop, held in May 2003, on “Earth System Analysis for Sustainability.”"

abstract = "Background
Urban sound levels are a ubiquitous environmental stressor and have been shown to be associated with a wide variety of health outcomes. While much is known about the predictors of A-weighted sound pressure levels in the urban environment, far less is known about other frequencies.
Objective
To develop a series of spatial-temporal sound models to predict A-weighted sound pressure levels, low, mid, and high frequency sound for Boston, Massachusetts.
Methods
Short-term sound levels were gathered at n = 400 sites from February 2015 – February 2016. Spatial and meteorological attributes at or near the sound monitoring site were obtained using publicly available data and a portable weather station. An elastic net variable selection technique was used to select predictors of A-weighted, low, mid, and high frequency sound.
Results
The final models for low, mid, high, and A-weighted sound levels explained 59 – 69% of the variability in each measure. Similar to other A-weighted models, our sound models included transportation related variables such as length of roads and bus lines in the surrounding area; distance to road and rail lines; traffic volume, vehicle mix, residential and commercial land use. However, frequency specific models highlighted additional predictors not included in the A-weighted model including temperature, vegetation, impervious surfaces, vehicle mix, and density of entertainment establishments and restaurants.
Conclusions
Building spatial temporal models to characterize sound levels across the frequency spectrum using an elastic net approach can be a promising tool for noise exposure assessments within the urban soundscape. Models of sound's character may give us additional important sound exposure metrics to be utilized in epidemiological studies."

abstract = "The natural ventilation rate in bedrooms at night has been found to be insufficient at times. To create good indoor air quality with minimal energy consumption, we need to know when the ventilation rate will be insufficient. To achieve this goal, we monitored indoor CO2 concentrations in bedrooms in 24 apartments, together with related outdoor parameters. With this dataset, we built an artificial neural network (ANN) model to predict when the ventilation rate would be insufficient. The sample sizes for the training set and test set are 2760 sample days and 690 sample days, respectively. The overall accuracy levels of this ANN model are 80.2% and 79.3% for the training set and test set, respectively. According to the model, the indoor CO2 concentration level is significantly affected by the building floor on which the apartment is located and nighttime outdoor temperature. Apartments on an upper floor usually had lower probability of the indoor CO2 concentration reaching 1000 ppm than apartments on a lower floor. Furthermore, the probability dropped to its lowest point at 15–20∘C, and it rose significantly when the nighttime outdoor temperature increased or decreased. Increasing wind strength decreased the probability only when the outdoor temperature was greater than approximately 20∘C. In contrast, when the temperature was low, increasing wind strength may have caused the probability to increase because of the uncomfortable sensation created by increasing wind velocity. Throughout the year, the probability is estimated to be high in the middle of summer and winter."

The regional air quality modeling system RAMS (Regional Atmospheric Modeling System)-CMAQ (Community Multi-scale Air Quality modeling system) is applied to analyze temporal and spatial variations in surface ozone concentration over Beijing and its surrounding region from July to October 2008. Comparison of simulated and observed meteorological elements and concentration of nitrogen oxides (NOx) and ozone at one urban site and three rural sites during Olympic Games show that model can generally reproduce the main observed feature of wind, temperature and ozone, but NOx concentration is overestimated. Although ozone concentration decreased during Olympics, high ozone episodes occurred on 24 July and 24 August with concentration of 360 and 245 μg/m3 at Aoyuncun site, respectively. The analysis of sensitive test, with and without emission controls, shows that emission controls could reduce ozone concentration in the afternoon when ozone concentration was highest but increase it at night and in the morning. The evolution of the weather system during the ozone episodes (24 July and 24 August) indicates that hot and dry air and a stable weak pressure field intensified the production of ozone and allowed it to accumulate. Process analysis at the urban site and rural site shows that under favorable weather condition on 24 August, horizontal transport was the main contributor of the rural place and the pollution from the higher layer would be transported to the surface layer. On 24 July, as the wind velocity was smaller, the impact of transport on the rural place was not obvious."
