abstract={The economic and social impact of poor air quality in towns and cities is increasingly being recognized, together with the need for effective ways of creating awareness of real-time air quality levels and their impact on human health. With local authority maintained monitoring stations being geographically sparse and the resultant datasets also featuring missing labels, computational data-driven mechanisms are needed to address the data sparsity challenge. In this paper, we propose a machine learning-based method to accurately predict the air quality index, using environmental monitoring data together with meteorological measurements. To do so, we develop an air quality estimation framework that implements a neural network that is enhanced with a novel non-linear autoregressive neural network with exogenous input model, especially designed for time series prediction. The framework is applied to a case study featuring different monitoring sites in London, with comparisons against other standard machine-learning-based predictive algorithms showing the feasibility and robust performance of the proposed method for different kinds of areas within an urban region.},

abstract={Recent studies on air pollution emphasized particulate matter impact on human health and climate changes. This impact generated a trend for developing research projects which deal with monitoring and forecasting air quality. This paper fits into this trend and presents an ANFIS (adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system) modelling approach to predict particulate matter concentration for short terms. The ANFIS technique was tested for three data sets covering all seasons specific to urban areas from Romania. The data sets type imposed the fuzzy inference system generating method and the optimization method. The resulted prediction model can be used to warn the population when the PM concentration exceeds standard limits, and also to extract useful data for knowledge-based modelling.},

abstract={Large epidemiological studies have shown that exposure to air pollution, in particular fine particulate matter (PM2.5), is harmful to human health. However, air pollution monitors which measure air pollutant concentrations are sparsely located, excluding large portions of the population, in particular non-urban populations, from studies. One approach to resolving this issue has been developing models to predict local PM2.5, NO2, and ozone in unmonitored areas based on satellite, meteorological, and land use data. These prediction models are typically developed using large amounts of input data and are highly computationally intensive. We have developed a flexible R package that allows environmental health researchers to design and train spatio-temporal models capable of predicting multiple pollutants, including PM2.5. We utilize H2O, an open source big data R platform, to achieve both performance and scalability when used in conjunction with cloud or cluster computing systems.},

abstract={The growing rate of urban and industrial development leads to high levels of air pollution in most countries around the world. Because air pollution has a major impact on human health, monitoring and forecasting of the most important pollutants concentrations are very important. The modelling of the non-linear and complex phenomena associated to air pollution is successfully performed using artificial intelligence-based methods. This paper aims to develop a model based on adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) technique for short-term prediction of particulate matter (PM) concentration. There are proposed three models, one that uses only PM concentrations as inputs, and the other two that have as additional inputs meteorological parameters. All models have as output the prediction of the next hour PM concentration. The simulation results for the three proposed models are compared using statistical indices, the best model being the one that takes into account the current hour temperature as additional input besides the PM concentrations.},

abstract={Microscopically small solid particles and liquid droplets suspended in the air, known as particulate matter (PM), may significantly affect not only human health but also urban, natural and agricultural systems. Therefore, it is imperative to keep the concentration levels of these pollutants below harmful thresholds. Forecasting tools based on machine learning have been used to estimate the concentration of PM and other pollutants in the atmosphere. However, PM data are uninterruptedly collected over time, thus producing a stream of data whose distribution may evolve over time. As traditional machine learning techniques do not have mechanisms to handle changes on data distribution at running time, they usually present limited prediction accuracy when facing such scenario. The overall goal of this work is to evaluate whether online sequential learning can improve the estimation accuracy of PM forecasting. To do so, online and offline algorithms based on Extreme Learning Machines (ELM) were compared, in order to evaluate their performance when applied to forecast hourly concentrations of PM. The experiments were performed using real-world data streams of PM concentration from different cities of the State of SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil. The obtained results show not only that online sequential learning approaches lead to smaller mean squared errors but also that the stability of the results is enhanced when such approaches are combined in ensembles.},

abstract={Due to its harmful effects on human health and agriculture, ground-level ozone concentrations are continually monitored nowadays in most places in the world. However, predicting ground-level ozone concentrations is difficult and thus poses a major concern in urban areas worldwide. In this paper, we investigate the use of deep recurrent neural nets to forecast ground-level ozone concentrations at Santiago (Chile), one of the most polluted cities in South America. It is found that the accuracy of current prediction models for peaks of the ozone concentration, 1-day ahead, is often lower than expected, which limits their practical utility as tools to anticipate critical pollution events. To address this issue, we propose to adopt a multitask learning criterion in which the model is not only trained to predict the expected value at the next time step but multiple quantiles of the response distribution. Experiments on real data illustrate that this approach improves the prediction accuracy for high values of the time series.},
