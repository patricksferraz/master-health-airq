abstract = {A new approach to simulating the urban environment with a mesocale model has been developed to identify efficient strategies for mitigating increases in surface air temperatures associated with the urban heat island (UHI). A key step in this process is to define a "global" roughness for the cityscape and to use this roughness to diagnose 10-m temperature, moisture, and winds within an atmospheric model. This information is used to calculate local exchange coefficients for different city surface types (each with their own "local roughness" lengths); each surface's energy balances, including surface air temperatures, humidity, and wind, are then readily obtained. The model was run for several summer days in 2001 for the New York City five-county area. The most effective strategy to reduce the surface radiometric and 2-m surface air temperatures was to increase the albedo of the city (impervious) surfaces. However, this caused increased thermal stress at street level, especially noontime thermal...},

A detailed investigation was conducted to determine levels and sources of Cd (cadmium), Cr (chromium), Cu (copper), Pb (lead), Zn (zinc), Ni (nick), and Hg (mercury) contamination in street dust from Shijiazhuang, China. The average concentrations of these metals were: Cd, 1.86 mg·kg −1 ; Cr, 131.7 mg·kg −1 ; Ni, 40.99 mg·kg −1 ; Cu, 91.06 mg·kg −1 ; Pb, 154.78 mg·kg −1 , Hg, 0.29 mg·kg −1 ; and Zn, 496.17 mg·kg −1 —all of which were greater than the local soil reference values. The concentrations of the heavy metals were mapped for the three Shijiazhuang ring roads, with the results showing significant differences between each ring. Application of enrichment factors and geoaccumulation indexes showed that there was significant enrichment and accumulation of Cd, Pb, Zn, and Hg. Multivariate statistical analyses showed that Cd, Pb, Zn, and Hg levels were mainly controlled by human activities, while Cr, Ni, and Cu levels were associated with natural sources. Absolute principal component scores with multiple linear regression (APCS-MLR) were applied to facilitate source apportionment. The results showed that the mixed (traffic and industry) group contributed 53.55%, 59.7%, and 62.25% of the Cd, Pb, and Zn concentration, respectively, while the natural sources group contributed 58.01%, 65.09%, and 66.91% of the Cu, Ni, and Cr concentration, respectively. The burning coal group was found to be responsible for 63.38% of the Hg present in the samples.

This implies that reliable tools for local urban climate studies supporting sustainable urban planning are needed. However, a realistic implementation of urban canopy processes still poses a serious challenge for weather and climate modelling for the current generation of numerical models. To address this demand, a new urban surface model (USM), describing the surface energy processes for urban environments, was developed and integrated as a module into the PALM large-eddy simulation model. The development of the presented first version of the USM originated from modelling the urban heat island during summer heat wave episodes and thus implements primarily processes important in such conditions. The USM contains a multi-reflection radiation model for shortwave and longwave radiation with an integrated model of absorption of radiation by resolved...},

This study collected remote sensing images and measured meteorological data of the summers of 1992-2017, Tianjin of China and aims to clarify patterns of spatial transfer and thermal comfort changes caused by a mega-UHI (Urban Heat Island). An analytic transfer matrix and the spatial autocorrelation were developed to study spatial pattern changes and features of the spatial transfer of thermal comfort caused by UHI. Results show these patterns in the affected areas can be divided into different levels: patterns of low-level affected areas transferred by circular expansion into block-mass jumping, while the position of high-level affected areas remains stable. The spatial transfer of thermal comfort in the affected areas shows two apparent stages: the transfer from areas of high-density and low-storied buildings and into areas of multiple storied buildings, and transfer from areas of low and multiple storied buildings into those of high storied buildings. This implies changes in urban planning can guide spatial, structural, and functional evolution. The study identifies features of spatial change and spatial patterns related to the influence of Mega-UHI on thermal comfort.

Many studies have investigated the impact of summer temperature on human health and have proposed mitigation strategies for summer heat waves. However, sub-tropical cities are still experiencing winter temperature variations. Increasing winter perceived temperature through the decades may soon affect city wellbeing, due to a larger temperature change between normal winter days and extreme cold events, which may cause higher health risk due to lack of adaptation and self-preparedness. Therefore, winter perceived temperature should also be considered and integrated in urban sustainable planning.

abstract = {An understanding of microbial pollution characteristics is needed for stormwater reuse and development of microorganism simulations in urban stormwater. This study investigated the discharge characteristics of faecal indicator bacteria (faecal coliforms) in urban runoff by field sampling both the underlying surfaces and the stormwater pipe outlet. Faecal coliform contamination in urban runoff was found to be frequent, and the highest instantaneous concentration reached 2.42 10 6 MPN/100 ml. Faecal coliforms did not show a consistent first flush effect amongst the different surfaces sampled, and this was exacerbated under rainfall events with high intensity. PROMETHEE (Preference Ranking Organization Method for Enrichment Evaluation) and GAIA (Geometrical Analysis for Interactive Aid) analyses were further applied to explore the ranking of pollutants, the relationship among the pollutants, and the factors affecting the contamination in cases of multiple underlying surfaces, multiple pollutants and rainfall events. For the pollutants of suspended solids (SS), total phosphorus (TP) and chemical oxygen demand (COD), the road sample contamination was significantly higher than on the roof surfaces. No such trend in ranking of faecal coliforms was observed. Rainfall depth and intensity were found to have a significant influence on stormwater contamination by physico-chemical pollutants, while having a somewhat smaller influence on faecal coliform contamination. Faecal coliform contamination is closely associated with the index related to the antecedent dry period. The average temperature and average relative humidity also showed a positive relationship with faecal coliform contamination. The effects of antecedent dry period duration on contamination of physico-chemical pollutants and faecal coliform are completely opposite. Antecedent dry period duration was positively related to the contamination of physico-chemical pollutants, but negatively related to faecal coliform contamination. Therefore, three variables, i.e. , antecedent dry period duration, average temperature and average relative humidity, might be used to model the survival/die-off of faecal coliform during the antecedent dry period.},

The city is the hub of modern human life and the urban transport sector is developing fast. Specifically, in the Internet era, the development of public transport has brought new challenges and opportunities to urban passenger transport. Thus, research on the energy demand and environmental emissions of the urban transport sector is significant and timely. This paper takes Beijing’s public transport as an example and applies the Long-range Energy Alternatives Planning (LEAP) model to analyze the energy demand and the main greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions under different scenarios during the period 2016–2030. The results show that: 1) if the government fails to guide the development of passenger transport appropriately, its energy demand and GHG emissions will rise rapidly and under the baseline scenario, the energy demand and emissions in 2030 are about 1.8 times...},

abstract = {Two radiative transfer models are presented that simplify calculations of street canyon spectral irradiances with minimum data input requirements, allowing better assessment of urban exposures than can be provided by standard unobstructed radiation measurements alone. Fast calculations improve the computational performance of radiation models, when numerous repetitions are required in time and location. The core of the models is the calculation of the spectral diffuse-to-global ratios (DGR) from an unobstructed global spectral measurement. The models are based on, and have been tested against, outcomes of the SMARTS2 algorithm (i.e. Simple Model of the Atmospheric Radiative Transfer of Sunshine). The modelled DGRs can then be used to partition global spectral irradiance values into their direct and diffuse components for different solar zenith angles. Finally, the effects of canyon obstructions can be evaluated independently on the direct and diffuse components, which are then recombined to give the total canyon irradiance. The first model allows ozone and aerosol inputs, while the second provides a further simplification, restricted to average ozone and aerosol contents but specifically designed for faster calculations. To assess the effect of obstructions and validate the calculations, a set of experiments with simulated obstructions (simulated canyons) were performed. The greatest source of uncertainty in the simplified calculations is in the treatment of diffuse radiation. The measurement-model agreement is therefore dependent on the region of the sky obscured and ranges from <5 % at all wavelengths to 20–40 % (wavelength dependent) when diffuse sky only is visible from the canyon.},

Passenger car fuel consumption is directly related to a number of technological aspects of a given car, driver behaviour, road and weather conditions and, especially at urban level, road structure and traffic flow and conditions. In this paper, passenger car fuel consumption was assumed to be a function of three input variables, i.e. day of week, hour of day and city zone. Over the period of 6 months (during 2015) a car was driven in the randomly chosen routes in the city of Niš (Serbia) in the period from 8 to 23 h. The fuel consumption data recorded through on-board diagnostics equipment were used for the development of Artificial Neural Network (ANN) models. In order to efficiently deal with a number of ANN design issues, to avoid usual trial and error procedure and develop robust, high performance ANN models, the Taguchi method was applied.

As compared with other building energy models, the MBEM has the following features: (1) it proposes a new approach for estimating indoor surface temperatures (roofs and walls surfaces) based on a support vector machine; (2) it uses a time-varying ventilation rate rather than an empirical constant to simulate the sensible heat flux exchange through ventilation; and (3) it considers the heat exchange between windows and the indoor air.
