abstract = {<p> Purpose There has been a growing concern about air quality because in recent years, industrial and vehicle emissions have resulted in unsatisfactory human health conditions. There is an urgent need for the measurements and estimations of particulate pollutants levels, especially in urban areas. As a contribution to this issue, the purpose of this paper is to use data from measured concentrations of particulate matter and meteorological conditions for the predictions of PM10. Design/methodology/approach The procedure included daily data collection of current PM10 concentrations for the city of São Carlos-SP, Brazil. These data series enabled to use an estimator based on artificial neural networks. Data sets were collected using the high-volume sampler equipment (VFA-MP10) in the period ranging from 1997 to 2006 and from 2014 to 2015. The predictive models were created using statistics from meteorological data. The models were developed using two neural network architectures, namely, perceptron multilayer (MLP) and non-linear autoregressive exogenous (NARX) inputs network. Findings It was observed that, over time, there was a decrease in the PM10 concentration rates. This is due to the implementation of more strict environmental laws and the development of less polluting technologies. The model NARX that used as input layer the climatic variables and the PM10 of the previous day presented the highest average absolute error. However, the NARX model presented the fastest convergence compared with the MLP network. Originality/value The presentation of a given PM10 concentration of the previous day improved the performance of the predictive models. This paper brings contributions with the NARX model applications. </p>},

The study focuses on urban areas, namely, Shah Alam, Petaling Jaya and Bandaraya Melaka. The diurnal variations of ground-level O 3 concentration were higher during HPE than those during non-HPE in all urban areas. The concentration of O 3 fluctuated more in 2014 than 2013 due to the higher incidences of HPE. Temperature and wind speed fluctuated with higher PM 10 , NO 2 and NO concentrations during HPE than those during non-HPE in all urban sites. Relative humidity was lower during HPE than that during non-HPE. Positive correlations were found between PM 10 and ozone during HPE for Shah Alam and Petaling Jaya with 0.81 and 0.79, respectively. Meanwhile, negative correlation (− 0.76) was recorded for Bandaraya Melaka. The non-HPE correlation of PM 10 and O 3 showed negative values for all locations except Petaling Jaya (0.02). Temperature and wind speed shows a strong positive correlation with ozone for all locations during HPE and non-HPE with the highest at Shah Alam (0.97). Inverse relationships were found between relative humidity and O 3 , in which the highest was for Shah Alam (− 0.96) in 2013 and Shah Alam (− 0.97) and Bandaraya Melaka (− 0.97) in 2014.

We develop a Bayesian approach to forecasting PM $$_{10}$$ 10 and O $$_3$$ 3 levels that efficiently deals with extensive amounts of input parameters, and test whether it outperforms classical models and experts. The new approach is used to fit models for PM $$_{10}$$ 10 and O $$_3$$ 3 level forecasting that can be used in daily practice. We also introduce a novel approach for comparing models to experts based on estimated cost matrices. The results for diverse air quality monitoring sites across Slovenia show that Bayesian models outperform classical models in both PM $$_{10}$$ 10 and O $$_3$$ 3 predictions. The proposed models perform better than experts in PM $$_{10}$$ 10 and are on par with experts in O $$_3$$ 3 predictions—where experts already base their predictions on predictions from a statistical model.

To this purpose, we exploited a multi-sensor, multi-platform database over a 3-year period (2015–2017) accompanied by a series of numerical simulations. The experimental setup included operational (24/7) vertically resolved aerosol profiles by an automated lidar ceilometer (ALC), vertically integrated aerosol properties by a Sun/sky photometer, and surface measurements of aerosol mass concentration, size distribution and chemical composition. This experimental set of observations was then complemented by modelling tools, including numerical weather prediction (NWP), trajectory statistical (TSM) and chemical transport (CTM) models, plus positive matrix factorisation (PMF) on both the PM10 chemical speciation analyses and particle size distributions. In a first companion study, we showed and discussed through...},

abstract = {Vehicular traffic plays an important role in atmospheric pollution and can be used as one of the key predictors in air-quality forecasting models. The models that can account for the role of traffic are especially valuable in urban areas, where high pollutant concentrations are often observed during particular times of day (rush hour) and year (winter). In this paper, we develop a generalized additive models approach to analyze the behavior of concentrations of nitrogen dioxide (NO), and particulate matter (PM), collected at the environmental monitoring stations distributed throughout the city of Turin, Italy, from December 2003 to April 2005. We describe nonlinear relationships between predictors and pollutants, that are adjusted for unobserved time-varying confounders. We examine several functional forms for the traffic variable and find that a simple form can often provide adequate modeling power. Our analysis shows that there is a saturation effect of traffic on NO, while such saturation is less evident in models linking traffic to PM behavior, having adjusted for meteorological covariates. Moreover, we consider the proposed models separately by seasons and highlight similarities and differences in the predictors’ partial effects. Finally, we show how forecasting can help in evaluating traffic regulation policies.},

In this study, an urban-scale traffic pollution dispersion model is developed considering street distribution, canyon geometry, background meteorology, traffic assignment, traffic emissions and air pollutant dispersion. In the model, vehicle exhausts generated from traffic flows first disperse inside street canyons along the micro-scale wind field generated by computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model. Then, pollutants leave the street canyon and further disperse over the urban area. On the basis of this model, the effects of canyon geometry on the distribution of NO</p> <p> and CO from traffic emissions were studied over the center of Beijing.

abstract = {This study aims to investigate and establish a suitable model that can help to estimate aerosol optical depth (AOD) in order to monitor aerosol variations especially during non-retrieval time. The relationship between actual ground measurements (such as air pollution index, visibility, relative humidity, temperature, and pressure) and AOD obtained with a CIMEL sun photometer was determined through a series of statistical procedures to produce an AOD prediction model with reasonable accuracy. The AOD prediction model calibrated for each wavelength has a set of coefficients. The model was validated using a set of statistical tests. The validated model was then employed to calculate AOD at different wavelengths. The results show that the proposed model successfully predicted AOD at each studied wavelength ranging from 340 nm to 1020 nm. To illustrate the application of the model, the aerosol size determined using measure AOD data for Penang was compared with that determined using the model. This was done by examining the curvature in the ln [AOD]–ln [wavelength] plot. Consistency was obtained when it was concluded that Penang was dominated by fine mode aerosol in 2012 and 2013 using both measured and predicted AOD data. These results indicate that the proposed AOD prediction model using routine measurements as input is a promising tool for the regular monitoring of aerosol variation during non-retrieval time.},

Modeling and forecasting daily movement of ambient air mean NO 2 concentration is an increasingly important task for its adverse effects on human health. With weekly quasi-periodic extension for daily movement of mean NO 2 concentration, the elliptic orbit model is introduced to depict its movement. Daily movement of mean NO 2 concentration as a time-series is mapped into the polar coordinates to build the elliptic orbit model, in which each 7-day-movement is described as one elliptic orbit. Experiments and result analysis indicate workability and effectiveness of the proposed method. It is shown that with weekly quasi-periodic extension, daily movements of mean NO 2 concentration at the given monitoring stations in China are well described by the elliptic orbit model, which presents a vivid description for analyzing daily movement of mean NO 2 concentration in a concise and intuitive way.},

In many cases, the intensive speed with which urban centres have been growing means that little attention has been paid to the role played by climatic factors in maintaining quality of life. Among the negative consequences of rapid city growth is the expansion of the problems posed by urban heat islands (UHIs), defined as areas in a city that are much warmer than other sites, especially in comparison with rural areas. This paper analyses the consistency of the UHI-related literature in three stages: first it outlines its characteristics and impacts in a wide variety of cities around the world, which poses pressures to public health in many different countries.
