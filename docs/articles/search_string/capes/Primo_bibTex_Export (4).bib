abstract = {<p>In this study, we developed a new urban modeling system that consists of a Modified Building Energy Model (MBEM) and the urban model of the Community Land Model (CLMU). Two goals can be achieved by using this numerical simulation system: (1) quantifying the emission of anthropogenic heat from buildings and (2) providing accurate parameters relating the urban energy balance to global climate models. As compared with other building energy models, the MBEM has the following features: (1) it proposes a new approach for estimating indoor surface temperatures (roofs and walls surfaces) based on a support vector machine; (2) it uses a time-varying ventilation rate rather than an empirical constant to simulate the sensible heat flux exchange through ventilation; and (3) it considers the heat exchange between windows and the indoor air. Model performance is evaluated against measured sensible heat fluxes in a suburban site where we introduced a footprint model to remove the contributions...},

abstract = {We develop a prognostic model called Pollen Emissions for Climate Models (PECM) for use within regional and global climate models to simulate pollen counts over the seasonal cycle based on geography, vegetation type, and meteorological parameters. Using modern surface pollen count data, empirical relationships between prior-year annual average temperature and pollen season start dates and end dates are developed for deciduous broadleaf trees (Acer, Alnus, Betula, Fraxinus, Morus, Platanus, Populus, Quercus, Ulmus), evergreen needleleaf trees (Cupressaceae, Pinaceae), grasses (Poaceae; C3, C4), and ragweed (Ambrosia). This regression model explains as much as 57 % of the variance in pollen phenological dates, and it is used to create a climate-flexible phenology that can be used to study the response of wind-driven pollen emissions to climate change. The emissions model is evaluated in the Regional Climate Model version 4 (RegCM4) over the continental United States by prescribing an emission...},
