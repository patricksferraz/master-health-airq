In the expanded model, benzene and PAHs are emitted from major point, area, and mobile sources, with emissions based on recent emission factors. Modelled PAHs undergo gas–particle partitioning (whereas benzene is only in the gas phase), atmospheric transport, oxidation, cloud processing, and dry and wet deposition. To represent PAH gas–particle partitioning, the Dachs–Eisenreich scheme was used, and we have improved gas–particle partitioning parameters based on an empirical analysis to get significantly better gas–particle partitioning results than the previous North American PAH model, AURAMS-PAH.

Therefore, development of various model strategies is a key element for the governmental and scientific communities.

To address this issue, two ML models (i.e., the back propagation (BP) network and support vector regression (SVR) with different input selections (i.e., original monitoring parameters and integrated Gaussian parameters) are proposed in this paper.

First, the initial pool of base ELMs is generated by using bootstrap sampling, which is then pre-pruned by calculating the pair-wise diversity measure of each base ELM. Second, partial-based ELMs among the initial pool after pre-pruning with higher precision and with greater diversity are selected by using an Improved Discrete Artificial Fish Swarm Algorithm (IDAFSA). Finally, the selected base ELMs are integrated through majority voting. The Experimental results on 16 datasets from the UCI Machine Learning Repository demonstrate that IDAFSEN can achieve better classification accuracy than other previously reported methods.

abstract = {The trend of urbanization has attracted increased attention towards urban areas around the world. Central business districts (CBDs) serve as the core of commercial activities of urban areas and are often associated with high-density population. Noise pollution in urban areas, especially CBDs, is considered as an important issue for planners and policy makers especially with regard to human health. Noise prediction models for CBD area of Karachi, Pakistan, have been developed in this study using land use and traffic parameters. These models show that traffic and built-up space (especially residential land use) contribute positively and vacant space contributes negatively to the noise levels. However, it was found that traffic volume has higher impact, than land use, in terms of on noise levels in CBD area. The models of this research are anticipated to be used for planning of urban CBD areas in other cities where noise levels do not meet international health standards. In addition, they would be useful in calculating the rate of traffic volume associated with residential land use.},

abstract = {Epidemiologic studies on acute effects of air pollution have generally been limited to larger cities, leaving questions about rural populations behind. Recently, we had developed a spatiotemporal model to predict daily [PM.sub.2.5] level at a 1 [km.sup.2] using satellite aerosol optical depth (AOD) data. Based on the results from the model, we applied a case-crossover study to evaluate the acute effect of [PM.sub.2.5] on mortality in North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia between 2007 and 2011. Mortality data were acquired from the Departments of Public Health in the States and modeled [PM.sub.2.5] exposures were assigned to the zip code of residence of each decedent. We performed various stratified analyses by age, sex, race, education, cause of death, residence, and environmental protection agency (EPA) standards. We also compared results of analyses using our modeled [PM.sub.2.5] levels and those imputed daily from the nearest monitoring station. 848,270 non-accidental death records were analyzed and we found each 10 [micro]g/[m.sup.3] increase in [PM.sub.2.5] (mean lag 0 and lag 1) was associated with a 1.56% (1.19 and 1.94) increase in daily deaths. Cardiovascular disease (2.32%, 1.57-3.07) showed the highest effect estimate. Blacks (2.19%, 1.43-2.96) and persons with education <8 year (3.13%, 2.08-4.19) were the most vulnerable populations. The effect of [PM.sub.2.5] on mortality still exists in zip code areas that meet the [PM.sub.2.5] EPA annual standard (2.06%, 1.97-2.15). The effect of [PM.sub.2.5] below both EPA daily and annual standards was 2.08% (95% confidence interval = 1.99-2.17). Our results showed more power and suggested that the [PM.sub.2.5] effects on rural populations have been underestimated due to selection bias and information bias. We have demonstrated that our AOD-based exposure models can be successfully applied to epidemiologic studies. This will add new study populations in rural areas, and will confer more generalizability to conclusions from such studies.
