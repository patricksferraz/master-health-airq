The integrated modelling system is developed by the Danish Meteorological Institute (DMI) in collaboration with several European universities. It is the baseline system in the HIRLAM Chemical Branch and used in several countries and different applications. The development was initiated at DMI more than 15 years ago. The model is based on the HIRLAM NWP model with online integrated pollutant transport and dispersion, chemistry, aerosol dynamics, deposition and atmospheric composition feedbacks. To make the model suitable for chemical weather forecasting in urban areas, the meteorological part was improved by implementation of urban parameterisations. The dynamical core was improved by implementing a locally mass-conserving...},

However, it was found that traffic volume has higher impact, than land use, in terms of on noise levels in CBD area. The models of this research are anticipated to be used for planning of urban CBD areas in other cities where noise levels do not meet international health standards.

Therefore, many governmental sectors and policy makers have been implementing operative solutions for cooling cities.

In this paper, a Selective ENsemble based on an Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) and Improved Discrete Artificial Fish swarm algorithm (IDAFSEN) is proposed, which overcomes the drawback that a single ELM is unstable in terms of its classification. First, the initial pool of base ELMs is generated by using bootstrap sampling, which is then pre-pruned by calculating the pair-wise diversity measure of each base ELM. Second, partial-based ELMs among the initial pool after pre-pruning with higher precision and with greater diversity are selected by using an Improved Discrete Artificial Fish Swarm Algorithm (IDAFSA). Finally, the selected base ELMs are integrated through majority voting. The Experimental results on 16 datasets from the UCI Machine Learning Repository demonstrate that IDAFSEN can achieve better classification accuracy than other previously reported methods. After a performance evaluation of the proposed approach, this paper looks at how this can be used in haze forecasting in China to protect human health.},

In the expanded model, benzene and PAHs are emitted from major point, area, and mobile sources, with emissions based on recent emission factors. Modelled PAHs undergo gas–particle partitioning (whereas benzene is only in the gas phase), atmospheric transport, oxidation, cloud processing, and dry and wet deposition.

The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of ground and satellite data assimilation of PM10 observations into the Weather Research and Forecasting model coupled with Chemistry (WRF-CHEM) numerical air quality model for Romanian territory. This is the first initiative of the kind for this domain of interest. Assimilation of satellite information – e.g. AOT's in air quality models is of interest due to the vast spatial coverage of the observations. Support Vector Regression (SVR) techniques are used to estimate the PM content from heterogeneous data sources, including EO products (Aerosol Optical Thickness), ground measurements and numerical model data (temperature, humidity, wind, etc.). In this study we describe the modeling framework employed and present the evaluation of the impact from the data assimilation of PM10 observations...},

abstract = {Epidemiologic studies on acute effects of air pollution have generally been limited to larger cities, leaving questions about rural populations behind. Recently, we had developed a spatiotemporal model to predict daily [PM.sub.2.5] level at a 1 [km.sup.2] using satellite aerosol optical depth (AOD) data. Based on the results from the model, we applied a case-crossover study to evaluate the acute effect of [PM.sub.2.5] on mortality in North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia between 2007 and 2011. Mortality data were acquired from the Departments of Public Health in the States and modeled [PM.sub.2.5] exposures were assigned to the zip code of residence of each decedent. We performed various stratified analyses by age, sex, race, education, cause of death, residence, and environmental protection agency (EPA) standards. We also compared results of analyses using our modeled [PM.sub.2.5] levels and those imputed daily from the nearest monitoring station. 848,270 non-accidental death records were analyzed and we found each 10 [micro]g/[m.sup.3] increase in [PM.sub.2.5] (mean lag 0 and lag 1) was associated with a 1.56% (1.19 and 1.94) increase in daily deaths. Cardiovascular disease (2.32%, 1.57-3.07) showed the highest effect estimate. Blacks (2.19%, 1.43-2.96) and persons with education <8 year (3.13%, 2.08-4.19) were the most vulnerable populations. The effect of [PM.sub.2.5] on mortality still exists in zip code areas that meet the [PM.sub.2.5] EPA annual standard (2.06%, 1.97-2.15). The effect of [PM.sub.2.5] below both EPA daily and annual standards was 2.08% (95% confidence interval = 1.99-2.17). Our results showed more power and suggested that the [PM.sub.2.5] effects on rural populations have been underestimated due to selection bias and information bias. We have demonstrated that our AOD-based exposure models can be successfully applied to epidemiologic studies. This will add new study populations in rural areas, and will confer more generalizability to conclusions from such studies.

abstract = {Health-risks from contaminated soils are assessed all over the world. An aspect that many risk assessments share is the heterogeneity in the distribution of contaminants. In a preceding study, we assessed potential health-risks for mothers and children living on mercury-contaminated soils in Switzerland using human biomonitoring-values (HBM) and soil samples. We assessed 64 mothers and 107 children who had resided in a defined area for at least 3 months. HBM-concentrations for mercury in urine and hair were measured, a detailed questionnaire was administered for each individual, and more than 4000 individual mercury soil values were obtained in 2015. In this study, we aimed at investigating possible associations of mercury soil- and HBM-values by re-analyzing our data, using predictions of the mercury concentrations at the exact location of the participant’s homes with a kriging approach.

One of the disadvantages gives negative impacts, such as traffic jam, which directly decreases a highway performance as well as increases air and noise pollution. A suitable policy has not been formulated to overcome the traffic jam in most highways in big cities. However, traffic demand management regard to noise pollution is required in most cities of developing countries, particularly Surabaya City, as a case study area. This study aims to understand the influence of saturated flow of highway on noise pollution for several types of road corridors. The results reveal that saturated flow of highway has a significant effect on noise pollution. By examining the alternatives of space-transport development strategies, the intention is to reduce noise pollution together with decreasing traffic jam due to decreasing the number of light vehicles.

The MESO-NH atmospheric model was used to simulate the local dynamics at multiple scales with horizontal resolution down to 500 m, and for the online calculation of the Lagrangian backward trajectories with 30-min temporal resolution. Airmass transport was performed along six principal pathways obtained by the weighted k-means clustering technique. Four of these centroids corresponded to a range of wind speeds over the English Channel: two for wind directions from the north-east and two from the south-west. Another pathway corresponded to a south-westerly continental transport. The backward trajectories of the largest and most dispersed sixth cluster contained low wind speeds, including sea-breeze circulations.
