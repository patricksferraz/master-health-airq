For residential exposure, this area is often the subject’s neighborhood. However, the variability of the size and nature of the neighborhoods makes comparison of the findings across studies difficult. This article examines the impact of the neighborhood’s definition on environmental noise exposure levels obtained from four commonly used sampling techniques: address point, façade, buffers, and official zoning. A high-definition noise model, built on a middle-sized French city, has been used to estimate LAeq,24 h exposure in the vicinity of 10,825 residential buildings. Twelve noise exposure indicators have been used to assess inhabitants’ exposure. Influence of urban environmental factors was analyzed using multilevel modeling. When the sampled area increases, the average exposure increases (+3.9 dB), whereas the SD decreases (−1.6 dB) (P<0.01). Most...},

However, urbanization is considered a metric that defines the socio-economic value of the city planning and management, if unplanned leads to many serious implications on the environment such as ecological imbalance, increased concentration of pollutants, loss of bio-diversity, etc. A steep increase in population growth, migration to cities and conversion of vegetated lands into other land use classes have been prime factors in expanding urban regions at faster urban growth rates causing sprawl in the periphery and the regions adjacent to the city resulting in increased temperatures.

The proposed study estimates the land use land cover changes particularly changes to urban class from other land use types such as croplands, shrubland, open areas, and water bodies and quantify these changes for a span of about five decades. Further, the impact of these land use/land cover changes is examined on spatial and temporal variations of meteorological parameters using the Weather Research and Forecast (WRF) Model. The urbanized areas appear to be one of the regions with highest changes in the values of the fluxes and temperatures where during daytime, the surface sensible heat flux values show a noticeable increase of 60–70 W m −2 which commensurate with increase in urbanization. Similarly, the nighttime LST and T2m show an increase of 3–5 and 2–3 K, respectively. The diurnal temperature range (DTR) of LST and surface temperature also shows a decrease of about 5 and 2–3 K, respectively, with increasing urbanization. Significant decrease in the magnitude of surface winds and relative humidity is also observed over the areas converted to urban form over a period of half a century. The impacts shown here have serious implications on human health, energy consumption, ventilation, and atmospheric pollution.},

abstract = {Two radiative transfer models are presented that simplify calculations of street canyon spectral irradiances with minimum data input requirements, allowing better assessment of urban exposures than can be provided by standard unobstructed radiation measurements alone. Fast calculations improve the computational performance of radiation models, when numerous repetitions are required in time and location. The core of the models is the calculation of the spectral diffuse-to-global ratios (DGR) from an unobstructed global spectral measurement. The models are based on, and have been tested against, outcomes of the SMARTS2 algorithm (i.e. Simple Model of the Atmospheric Radiative Transfer of Sunshine). The modelled DGRs can then be used to partition global spectral irradiance values into their direct and diffuse components for different solar zenith angles. Finally, the effects of canyon obstructions can be evaluated independently on the direct and diffuse components, which are then recombined to give the total canyon irradiance. The first model allows ozone and aerosol inputs, while the second provides a further simplification, restricted to average ozone and aerosol contents but specifically designed for faster calculations. To assess the effect of obstructions and validate the calculations, a set of experiments with simulated obstructions (simulated canyons) were performed. The greatest source of uncertainty in the simplified calculations is in the treatment of diffuse radiation. The measurement-model agreement is therefore dependent on the region of the sky obscured and ranges from <5 % at all wavelengths to 20–40 % (wavelength dependent) when diffuse sky only is visible from the canyon.},

Two goals can be achieved by using this numerical simulation system: (1) quantifying the emission of anthropogenic heat from buildings and (2) providing accurate parameters relating the urban energy balance to global climate models. As compared with other building energy models, the MBEM has the following features: (1) it proposes a new approach for estimating indoor surface temperatures (roofs and walls surfaces) based on a support vector machine; (2) it uses a time-varying ventilation rate rather than an empirical constant to simulate the sensible heat flux exchange through ventilation; and (3) it considers the heat exchange between windows and the indoor air.

This study collected remote sensing images and measured meteorological data of the summers of 1992-2017, Tianjin of China and aims to clarify patterns of spatial transfer and thermal comfort changes caused by a mega-UHI (Urban Heat Island). An analytic transfer matrix and the spatial autocorrelation were developed to study spatial pattern changes and features of the spatial transfer of thermal comfort caused by UHI. Results show these patterns in the affected areas can be divided into different levels: patterns of low-level affected areas transferred by circular expansion into block-mass jumping, while the position of high-level affected areas remains stable. The spatial transfer of thermal comfort in the affected areas shows two apparent stages: the transfer from areas of high-density and low-storied buildings and into areas of multiple storied buildings, and transfer from areas of low and multiple storied buildings into those of high storied buildings. This implies changes in urban planning can guide spatial, structural, and functional evolution.

abstract = {An understanding of microbial pollution characteristics is needed for stormwater reuse and development of microorganism simulations in urban stormwater. This study investigated the discharge characteristics of faecal indicator bacteria (faecal coliforms) in urban runoff by field sampling both the underlying surfaces and the stormwater pipe outlet. Faecal coliform contamination in urban runoff was found to be frequent, and the highest instantaneous concentration reached 2.42 10 6 MPN/100 ml. Faecal coliforms did not show a consistent first flush effect amongst the different surfaces sampled, and this was exacerbated under rainfall events with high intensity. PROMETHEE (Preference Ranking Organization Method for Enrichment Evaluation) and GAIA (Geometrical Analysis for Interactive Aid) analyses were further applied to explore the ranking of pollutants, the relationship among the pollutants, and the factors affecting the contamination in cases of multiple underlying surfaces, multiple pollutants and rainfall events. For the pollutants of suspended solids (SS), total phosphorus (TP) and chemical oxygen demand (COD), the road sample contamination was significantly higher than on the roof surfaces. No such trend in ranking of faecal coliforms was observed. Rainfall depth and intensity were found to have a significant influence on stormwater contamination by physico-chemical pollutants, while having a somewhat smaller influence on faecal coliform contamination. Faecal coliform contamination is closely associated with the index related to the antecedent dry period. The average temperature and average relative humidity also showed a positive relationship with faecal coliform contamination. The effects of antecedent dry period duration on contamination of physico-chemical pollutants and faecal coliform are completely opposite. Antecedent dry period duration was positively related to the contamination of physico-chemical pollutants, but negatively related to faecal coliform contamination. Therefore, three variables, i.e. , antecedent dry period duration, average temperature and average relative humidity, might be used to model the survival/die-off of faecal coliform during the antecedent dry period.},
