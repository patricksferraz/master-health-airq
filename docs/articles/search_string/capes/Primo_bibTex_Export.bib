abstract = {Spatial patterns are important features for understanding regional air quality variability. Statistical analysis tools, such as empirical orthogonal function (EOF), have been extensively used to identify and classify spatial patterns. These tools, however, do not directly reveal the related weather conditions. This study used singular value decomposition (SVD) to identify spatial air pollution index (API) patterns related to meteorological conditions in China, one of world’s regions facing catastrophic air pollution. The monthly API and four meteorological variables (precipitation, surface air temperature, humidity, and wind speed) during 2001–2012 in 42 cities in China were used. The two leading SVD spatial patterns display the API anomalies with the same sign across China and opposite signs between northern and southern China, respectively. The meteorological variables have different relationships with these patterns. For the first pattern, wind speed is the most important. The key regions, where the correlations between the API field and the wind speed’s SVD time series are significant at the 99% confidence level, are found nationwide. Precipitation and air temperature are also important in the southern and northern portions of eastern China, respectively. For the second pattern, the key regions occur mainly in northern China for temperature and humidity and southern China for wind speed. Air humidity has the largest contribution to this pattern. The weather-API relationships characterized by these spatial patterns are useful for selecting factors for statistical air quality prediction models and determining the geographic regions with high prediction skills.},

This study aims to investigate the spatial variation in the source of air pollution; identify the most significant parameterscontributing to the air pollution and to develop the best receptor model for predicting air pollution index (API). Data from five monitoring stations base on five year's observation (2007-2011) were used. Multivariate techniques such as cluster analysis (HACA), discriminate analysis (DA), principal component analysis (PCA), factor analysis (FA) and modeling techniques comprising of artificial neural network (ANN) and multiple linear regression (MLR) were used in this study. HACA was able to group the five monitoring stations into three clusters, indicating that one station in each cluster can provide a reasonable accurate spatial assessment of air quality within the study area. The result for standard mode, forward stepwise and backward stepwise DA gave a correct assignation of 82.37% (p < 0.05) which indicate that all the parameters significantly discriminate spatially. PCA and FA for the three clusters account for more than 62%, 56% and 58% of the total variance respectively indicating that the source of air pollution are from anthropogenic induced point source and non-point source. ANN gave a better prediction at [R.sup.2] = 0.93 and RMSE = 4.87 compared with MLR A[R.sup.2] = 0.70 and RMSE = 9.57. This indicates that ANN can be applied with more precision in modeling and understanding the dynamic nature of API compared with MLR. However, it can be concluded that the atmosphere exhibit a complex reaction which is made more complicated by man through his daily activities and multivariate analysis, modeling techniques will help to understand the dynamic structure of the source of pollution, reduce the cost of monitoring unnecessary sampling site, save time and accurately predict air pollution index. These findings can provide stakeholders a basic for understanding and developing air pollution control strategies in order to reduce their possible health and environmental effect.

In general, three ANN-based approaches have been found for this task: ANN trained via learning algorithms, hybrid systems that combine search algorithms with ANNs, and hybrid systems that combine ANN with other forecasters.

Data were used from two different monitoring stations located on the eastern Mediterranean coast: (1) a traffic monitoring station in Tel Aviv located in an urban region with heavy traffic and (2) a general air quality monitoring station in Haifa Bay located in Israel’s main industrial region. At each station, hourly, daily, monthly, seasonal, and annual data of benzene, NO x , mean temperature, relative humidity, inversion level, and temperature gradient were analyzed over 3 years: 2008, 2009, and 2010. A prediction model for benzene rates based on NO x levels (which are monitored regularly) was developed to contribute to a better estimation of benzene. The severity of benzene pollution was found to be considerably higher at the traffic monitoring station than at the general air quality station, despite the location of the latter in an industrial area. Hourly, daily, monthly, seasonal, and annual patterns have been shown to coincide with anthropogenic activities (traffic), the day of the week, and atmospheric conditions. A strong correlation between NO x and benzene allowed the development of a prediction model for benzene rates based on NO x , the day of the week, and the month. The model succeeded in predicting the benzene values throughout the year.

Among the six criteria, the pollutant carbon monoxide (CO) is given least attention for imperative modeling. The frequent exceedance of CO emissions can be harmful to human health and the environment. Effectively managing of CO critically demands an accurate emissions estimate and an efficient model for forecasting the future status of the CO. Most of the CO forecast models have been developed to describe the temporal and spatial distribution of CO on roadways. Main categories of CO models are deterministic, statistical, hybrid, and neural network in nature. This paper reviews attempts and resources for carrying out CO dispersion modeling studies. The scope and restraint associated with various modeling attempts are also discussed. Key words: computational models, carbon monoxide, forecast, vehicle exhaust, health impact, artificial intelligence. L'utilisation de modeles informaiiques joue un role vital dans les processus de reglementalions environnementales. Les procedes de modelisation permetlenl d'elucider rapidement les relations complexes entre les emissions environnemenlales, la qualile du milieu, et les impacts humains el ecologiques. Parmi les six principales formes, la pollution par le monoxyde de carbone (CO) est celle qui recoil le moins d'atiention pour imposer sa modelisation. Les exces frequents des emissions de CO peuvent nuire a la sante et a l'environnement. L'amenagement efficace du CO necessite de facon imperative une estimation precise des emissions et un modele efficace pour predire le statut futur du CO. La plupart des modeles de prediction du CO ont ete developpes pour decrire la distribution spatiotemporelle du CO le long des routes. Les principales categories de modeles sont de nature deterministe, statistique, hybride et comme reseau neutre. Les auteurs passent en revue les tentatives et les ressources necessaires pour realiser des etudes de modelisation sur la dispersion du CO. On discute egalement l'ampleur et les contraintes associees a diverses tentatives de modelisations.

abstract = {The difficulty in forecasting concentration trends with a reasonable error is still an open problem. In this paper, an effort has been made to this purpose. Artificial Neural Networks are used in order to forecast the maximum daily value of the European Regional Pollution Index as well as the number of consecutive hours, during the day, with at least one of the pollutants above a threshold concentration, 24 to 72 h ahead. The prediction concerns seven different places within the Greater Athens Area, Greece. The meteorological and air pollution data used in this study have been recorded by the network of the Greek Ministry of the Environment, Physical Planning, and Public Works over a 5-year period, 2001-2005. The hourly values of air pressure and global solar irradiance for the same period have been recorded by the National Observatory of Athens. The results are in a very good agreement with the real-monitored data at a statistical significance level of p<0.01.

First the RF model is built by averaging the predictions from 500 decision/regression trees, and then Random Forest Regressor from the python package scikit-learn is used to run the algorithm. First a selection of the best predictors (PM2.5, PM10, and SO2) is performed, based on Partial Mutual Information (PMI), which measures the degree of predictability of the output variable knowing the input variable, and then the daily AQI value is predicted, through PEK-based machine learning, by using the previous day’s meteorological and pollution conditions.},

The usual factors affecting the characteristics and composition of PM include industrial emissions and meteorological factors (temperature, humidity, wind speed, rain volume) as well as bus-station-related factors such as fuel combustion in vehicles, wear of vehicle components, cigarette smoking, and vehicle flow. Several studies have proven that bus stops can accumulate high PM levels, thereby elevating passengers’ exposure to PM while waiting at bus stations, and leading to dire health outcomes such as cardiovascular disease (CVD), respiratory effects, and diabetes. In order to accurately predict PM pollution, an artificial neural network (ANN) and adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference systems (ANFIS) have been developed.

Interactions and synergistic effects between the three types of weather call for integrated assessment, forecasting, and communication of air quality. Today's air quality legislation falls short of addressing air quality degradation by biological weather, despite increasing evidence for the feasibility of both mitigation and adaptation policy options. In comparison with the existing capabilities for physical and chemical weather, the monitoring of biological weather is lacking stable operational agreements and resources. Furthermore, integrated effects of physical, chemical, and biological weather suggest a critical review of air quality management practices.

Issues considered in selecting specific monitoring data or new monitoring campaigns include: needed spatial resolution, exposure measurement error and its impact on health effect estimates, spatial alignment and compatibility with the cohort, and feasibility and expense. Sources of existing data largely include administrative monitoring data, predictions from air dispersion or chemical transport models and remote sensing (specifically satellite) data.

The aim is to reduce vehicle emissions in the most polluted road segments and optimizing the pollution levels. For this we propose the use of historical and real time pollution records and contextual data to calculate the air quality index on road networks and generate recommendations for reassigning traffic flow in order to improve the on-road air quality. The resulting air quality indexes are used in the system's traffic network generation, which the cartography is represented by a weighted graph. The weights evolve according to the pollution indexes and path properties and the graph is therefore dynamic. Furthermore, the systems use the available pollution data and meteorological records in order to predict the on-road pollutant levels by using an artificial...},

abstract = {Air pollutants such as benzene (\[\text {C}_6\text {H}_6\]) have accelerated the rate of cancer among human beings. Currently, atmospheric contamination is measured using spatially separated networks with limited sensors. However, the expenses involving multiple sensors with varying sizes limit the operational efficiency. Therefore, in this paper, a novel multi-objective regression model is proposed to predict benzene concentration in the ambient air pollution data, without need to deploy actual sensors for benzene detection. It is possible because there is a relation among various atmospheric gasses and thus regression can be performed to measure \[\text {C}_6\text {H}_6\] if the concentration level of other gasses is known. Proposed technique utilizes adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) and particle swarm optimization (PSO) to predict \[\text {C}_6\text {H}_6\] density in the air. PSO is employed to enhance the accuracy of ANFIS for runtime parameter tuning by calculating multi-objective fitness function which involves accuracy, root mean squared error and correlation (r). The proposed technique is tested on well-known publicly available air pollution datasets and on real-time primary dataset for quantitative analysis. Experimental results indicate that the proposed method consistently outperforms over available methods to predict \[\text {C}_6\text {H}_6\] concentration in the atmosphere. Thus, it is well suitable to build self-dependable time and cost-effective benzene prediction model.},

A high concentration of PM is known to seriously cause adverse health effects to humans especially a small-sized particle, known as PM2.5. Not only health effects, environmental effects are also obviously observed. This work aims to estimate a likelihood of PM2.5 exceeding a pre-defined safety threshold. Multiple machine learning models are explored in this work. Particularly, classification models are implemented based on meteorological data and air pollutant features measured at different altitudes above a ground level. These features are shifted back to various time steps resulting in more insightful time-lagged features. Furthermore, a feature selection technique is implemented to specify a desirable set of important features. A re-sampling technique is also employed to address an unbalancing level of the response value in an original data set. The...},
