TI  - A Novel Air Quality Early-Warning System Based on Artificial Intelligence.
LID - 3505
AB  - The problem of air pollution is a persistent issue for mankind and becoming
      increasingly serious in recent years, which has drawn worldwide attention.
      Establishing a scientific and effective air quality early-warning system is
      really significant and important. Regretfully, previous research didn’t
      thoroughly explore not only air pollutant prediction but also air quality
      evaluation, and relevant research work is still scarce, especially in China.
      Therefore, a novel air quality early-warning system composed of prediction and
      evaluation was developed in this study. Firstly, the advanced data preprocessing 
      technology Improved Complete Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition with Adaptive 
      Noise (ICEEMDAN) combined with the powerful swarm intelligence algorithm Whale
      Optimization Algorithm (WOA) and the efficient artificial neural network Extreme 
      Learning Machine (ELM) formed the prediction model. Then the predictive results
      were further analyzed by the method of fuzzy comprehensive evaluation, which
      offered intuitive air quality information and corresponding measures. The
      proposed system was tested in the Jing-Jin-Ji region of China, a representative
      research area in the world, and the daily concentration data of six main air
      pollutants in Beijing, Tianjin, and Shijiazhuang for two years were used to
      validate the accuracy and efficiency. The results show that the prediction model 
      is superior to other benchmark models in pollutant concentration prediction and
      the evaluation model is satisfactory in air quality level reporting compared with
      the actual status. Therefore, the proposed system is believed to play an
      important role in air pollution control and smart city construction all over the 
      world in the future.

LID - 2333794X19874679
AB  - Crop waste burning in open fields is a matter of concern in relation to
      health-related complications in humans of all age groups, especially children. An
      epidemiological study was been done on school children to estimate the decline in
      their physiological parameters due to crop residue burning activity. A total of
      150 children were inspected for 3 years (2013-2016) at 3 different sites in
      India. During sampling periods, spirometric tests, ambient particulate matter
      having size ≥10 µg−3 and ≥2.5 µg−3, and other covariates were measured twice in a
      fortnight. After adjustment of data in multivariate mixed-effect model,
      prediction and statistical analyses were done. From results obtained, it has been
      observed that season wise, the level of fine particulate matter (PM10 and PM2.5) 
      was higher in rice crop residue burning seasons than in wheat crop residue
      burning seasons by 87% to 123% than permitted monthly limits. As per
      dose-response relationship, maximum degradation was observed in forced vital
      capacity (−7.62%) and peak expiratory flow (−6.23%) parameters from their
      baseline values due to burning activities. Prediction equations have been
      purposed to observe the future trends in physiological parameters of children.
      Based on Tiffeneau index, an unrecoverable effect was seen in lung parameters.
      Trends were alarming and may cause serious complications in early age of humans.

TI  - Street Dust Heavy Metal Pollution Source Apportionment and Sustainable Management
      in A Typical City—Shijiazhuang, China.
LID - 2625
AB  - Street dust is repeatedly raised by the wind as a secondary suspension, helping
      heavy metals therein to enter the human body through the respiratory system,
      harming human health. A detailed investigation was conducted to determine levels 
      and sources of Cd (cadmium), Cr (chromium), Cu (copper), Pb (lead), Zn (zinc), Ni
      (nick), and Hg (mercury) contamination in street dust from Shijiazhuang, China.
      The average concentrations of these metals were: Cd, 1.86 mg·kg−1; Cr, 131.7
      mg·kg−1; Ni, 40.99 mg·kg−1; Cu, 91.06 mg·kg−1; Pb, 154.78 mg·kg−1, Hg, 0.29
      mg·kg−1; and Zn, 496.17 mg·kg−1—all of which were greater than the local soil
      reference values. The concentrations of the heavy metals were mapped for the
      three Shijiazhuang ring roads, with the results showing significant differences
      between each ring. Application of enrichment factors and geoaccumulation indexes 
      showed that there was significant enrichment and accumulation of Cd, Pb, Zn, and 
      Hg. Multivariate statistical analyses showed that Cd, Pb, Zn, and Hg levels were 
      mainly controlled by human activities, while Cr, Ni, and Cu levels were
      associated with natural sources. Absolute principal component scores with
      multiple linear regression (APCS-MLR) were applied to facilitate source
      apportionment. The results showed that the mixed (traffic and industry) group
      contributed 53.55%, 59.7%, and 62.25% of the Cd, Pb, and Zn concentration,
      respectively, while the natural sources group contributed 58.01%, 65.09%, and
      66.91% of the Cu, Ni, and Cr concentration, respectively. The burning coal group 
      was found to be responsible for 63.38% of the Hg present in the samples. These
      results provide a useful theoretical basis for Shijiazhuang authorities to
      address heavy metal pollution management.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Prediction of Increasing Winter Perceived Temperature across a
      Sub-Tropical City for Sustainable Planning and Climate Change Mitigation.
LID - 497
AB  - Climate variability has been documented as being key to influencing human
      wellbeing across cities as it is linked to mortality and illness due to changes
      in the perceived weather cycle. Many studies have investigated the impact of
      summer temperature on human health and have proposed mitigation strategies for
      summer heat waves. However, sub-tropical cities are still experiencing winter
      temperature variations. Increasing winter perceived temperature through the
      decades may soon affect city wellbeing, due to a larger temperature change
      between normal winter days and extreme cold events, which may cause higher health
      risk due to lack of adaptation and self-preparedness. Therefore, winter perceived
      temperature should also be considered and integrated in urban sustainable
      planning. This study has integrated the increasing winter perceived temperature
      as a factor for developing spatiotemporal protocols for mitigating the adverse
      impact of climate change. Land surface temperature (LST) derived from satellite
      images and building data extracted from aerial photographs were used to simulate 
      the adjusted wind chill equivalent temperature (AWCET) particularly for
      sub-tropical scenarios between 1990 and 2010 of the Kowloon Peninsula, Hong Kong.
      Compared with perceived temperature based on the representative station located
      at the headquarters of the Hong Kong Observatory, the temperature of half the
      study area in the Kowloon Peninsula has raised by 1.5 °C. The areas with less
      green space and less public open space in 2010 show higher relative temperatures.
      Socioeconomically deprived areas (e.g., areas with lower median monthly income)
      may suffer more from this scenario, but not all types of socioeconomic
      disparities are associated with poor sustainable planning. Based on our results
      and the “no-one left behind” guideline from the United Nations, climate change
      mitigation should be conducted by targeting socioeconomic neighborhoods more than
      just aging communities.

TI  - Particulate Matter Exposure of Passengers at Bus Stations: A Review.
LID - 2886
AB  - This review clarifies particulate matter (PM) pollution, including its levels,
      the factors affecting its distribution, and its health effects on passengers
      waiting at bus stations. The usual factors affecting the characteristics and
      composition of PM include industrial emissions and meteorological factors
      (temperature, humidity, wind speed, rain volume) as well as bus-station-related
      factors such as fuel combustion in vehicles, wear of vehicle components,
      cigarette smoking, and vehicle flow. Several studies have proven that bus stops
      can accumulate high PM levels, thereby elevating passengers’ exposure to PM while
      waiting at bus stations, and leading to dire health outcomes such as
      cardiovascular disease (CVD), respiratory effects, and diabetes. In order to
      accurately predict PM pollution, an artificial neural network (ANN) and adaptive 
      neuro-fuzzy inference systems (ANFIS) have been developed. ANN is a data modeling
      method of proven effectiveness in solving complex problems in the fields of
      alignment, prediction, and classification, while the ANFIS model has several
      advantages including non-requirement of a mathematical model, simulation of human
      thinking, and simple interpretation of results compared with other predictive
      methods.

TI  - Dynamic Human Environmental Exposome Revealed by Longitudinal Personal
      Monitoring.
PG  - 277-291.e31
AB  - Human health is dependent upon environmental exposures, yet the diversity and
      variation in exposures is poorly understood. We developed a sensitive method to
      monitor personal airborne biological and chemical exposures and followed the
      personal exposomes of 15 individuals for up to 890 days and over 66 distinct
      geographical locations. We found that individuals are potentially exposed to
      thousands of pan-domain species and chemical compounds, including insecticides
      and carcinogens. Personal biological and chemical exposomes are highly dynamic
      and vary spatial-temporally, even for individuals located in the same general
      geographical region. Integrated analysis of biological and chemical exposomes
      revealed strong location-dependent relationships. Finally, construction of an
      exposome interaction network demonstrated the presence of distinct yet
      interconnected human- and environment-centric clouds, comprised of interacting
      ecosystems such as human, flora, pets and arthropods. Overall, we demonstrate
      that human exposomes are diverse, dynamic, spatiotemporally-driven interaction
      networks with the potential to impact human health.

TI  - Comparison of Machine Learning Models for Hazardous Gas Dispersion Prediction in 
      Field Cases.
LID - 1450
AB  - Dispersion prediction plays a significant role in the management and emergency
      response to hazardous gas emissions and accidental leaks. Compared with
      conventional atmospheric dispersion models, machine leaning (ML) models have both
      high accuracy and efficiency in terms of prediction, especially in field cases.
      However, selection of model type and the inputs of the ML model are still
      essential problems. To address this issue, two ML models (i.e., the back
      propagation (BP) network and support vector regression (SVR) with different input
      selections (i.e., original monitoring parameters and integrated Gaussian
      parameters) are proposed in this paper. To compare the performances of presented 
      ML models in field cases, these models are evaluated using the Prairie Grass and 
      Indianapolis field data sets. The influence of the training set scale on the
      performances of ML models is analyzed as well. Results demonstrate that the
      integrated Gaussian parameters indeed improve the prediction accuracy in the
      Prairie Grass case. However, they do not make much difference in the Indianapolis
      case due to their inadaptability to the complex terrain conditions. In addition, 
      it can be summarized that the SVR shows better generalization ability with
      relatively small training sets, but tends to under-fit the training data. In
      contrast, the BP network has a stronger fitting ability, but sometimes suffers
      from an over-fitting problem. As a result, the model and input selection
      presented in this paper will be of great help to environmental and public health 
      protection in real applications.

TI  - Pollutant composition modification of the effect of air pollution on progression 
      of coronary artery calcium: the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis.
LID - e024
AB  - Background: Differences in traffic-related air pollution (TRAP) composition may
      cause heterogeneity in associations between air pollution exposure and
      cardiovascular health outcomes. Clustering multi-pollutant measurements allows
      investigation of effect modification by TRAP profiles. Methods: We measured TRAP 
      components with fixed-site and on-road instruments for two two-week periods in
      Baltimore, Maryland. We created representative TRAP profiles for cold and warm
      seasons using predictive k-means clustering. We predicted cluster membership for 
      1005 participants in the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis and Air Pollution 
      with follow-up between 2000 and 2012. We estimated cluster-specific relationships
      between coronary artery calcification (CAC) progression and long-term exposure to
      fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and oxides of nitrogen (NOX). Results: We
      identified two clusters in the cold season, notable for higher ratios of gases
      and ultrafine particles, respectively. A 5 μg/m3 difference in PM2.5 was
      associated with 17.0 (95% Confidence Interval [CI]: 7.2, 26.7) and 42.6 (95% CI: 
      25.7, 59.4) Agatston units/year CAC progression among participants in clusters 1 
      and 2, respectively (effect modification p=0.006). A 40ppb difference in NOX was 
      associated with 22.2 (95% CI: 7.7, 36.7) and 41.9 (95% CI: 23.7, 60.2) Agatston
      units/year CAC progression in clusters 1 and 2, respectively (p=0.08). Similar
      trends occurred using clusters identified from warm season measurements. Clusters
      correlated highly with baseline pollution level. Conclusions: Clustering TRAP
      measurements identified spatial differences in composition. We found evidence of 
      greater CAC progression rates per unit PM2.5 exposures among people living in
      areas characterized by high ratios of ultrafine particle counts relative to NOX
      concentrations.

TI  - LaSVM-based big data learning system for dynamic prediction of air pollution in
      Tehran.
LID - 300
AB  - Due to critical impacts of air pollution, prediction and monitoring of air
      quality in urban areas are important tasks. However, because of the dynamic
      nature and high spatio-temporal variability, prediction of the air pollutant
      concentrations is a complex spatio-temporal problem. Distribution of pollutant
      concentration is influenced by various factors such as the historical pollution
      data and weather conditions. Conventional methods such as the support vector
      machine (SVM) or artificial neural networks (ANN) show some deficiencies when
      huge amount of streaming data have to be analyzed for urban air pollution
      prediction. In order to overcome the limitations of the conventional methods and 
      improve the performance of urban air pollution prediction in Tehran, a
      spatio-temporal system is designed using a LaSVM-based online algorithm.
      Pollutant concentration and meteorological data along with geographical
      parameters are continually fed to the developed online forecasting system.
      Performance of the system is evaluated by comparing the prediction results of the
      Air Quality Index (AQI) with those of a traditional SVM algorithm. Results show
      an outstanding increase of speed by the online algorithm while preserving the
      accuracy of the SVM classifier. Comparison of the hourly predictions for next
      coming 24 h, with those of the measured pollution data in Tehran pollution
      monitoring stations shows an overall accuracy of 0.71, root mean square error of 
      0.54 and coefficient of determination of 0.81. These results are indicators of
      the practical usefulness of the online algorithm for real-time spatial and
      temporal prediction of the urban air quality.

TI  - Air Pollution Forecasts: An Overview.
LID - 780
AB  - Air pollution is defined as a phenomenon harmful to the ecological system and the
      normal conditions of human existence and development when some substances in the 
      atmosphere exceed a certain concentration. In the face of increasingly serious
      environmental pollution problems, scholars have conducted a significant quantity 
      of related research, and in those studies, the forecasting of air pollution has
      been of paramount importance. As a precaution, the air pollution forecast is the 
      basis for taking effective pollution control measures, and accurate forecasting
      of air pollution has become an important task. Extensive research indicates that 
      the methods of air pollution forecasting can be broadly divided into three
      classical categories: statistical forecasting methods, artificial intelligence
      methods, and numerical forecasting methods. More recently, some hybrid models
      have been proposed, which can improve the forecast accuracy. To provide a clear
      perspective on air pollution forecasting, this study reviews the theory and
      application of those forecasting models. In addition, based on a comparison of
      different forecasting methods, the advantages and disadvantages of some methods
      of forecasting are also provided. This study aims to provide an overview of air
      pollution forecasting methods for easy access and reference by researchers, which
      will be helpful in further studies.

TI  - An Evidence-Based Review of Impacts, Strategies and Tools to Mitigate Urban Heat 
      Islands.
LID - 1600
AB  - The impacts of climate changes on cities, which are home to over half of the
      world’s population, are already being felt. In many cases, the intensive speed
      with which urban centres have been growing means that little attention has been
      paid to the role played by climatic factors in maintaining quality of life. Among
      the negative consequences of rapid city growth is the expansion of the problems
      posed by urban heat islands (UHIs), defined as areas in a city that are much
      warmer than other sites, especially in comparison with rural areas. This paper
      analyses the consistency of the UHI-related literature in three stages: first it 
      outlines its characteristics and impacts in a wide variety of cities around the
      world, which poses pressures to public health in many different countries. Then
      it introduces strategies which may be employed in order to reduce its effects,
      and finally it analyses available tools to systematize the initial high level
      assessment of the phenomenon for multidisciplinary teams involved in the urban
      planning process. The analysis of literature on the characteristics, impacts,
      strategies and digital tools to assess on the UHI, reveals the wide variety of
      parameters, methods, tools and strategies analysed and suggested in the different
      studies, which does not always allow to compare or standardize the diagnosis or
      solutions.

TI  - Design of an Air Pollution Monitoring Campaign in Beijing for Application to
      Cohort Health Studies.
LID - 1580
AB  - No cohort studies in China on the health effects of long-term air pollution
      exposure have employed exposure estimates at the fine spatial scales desirable
      for cohort studies with individual-level health outcome data. Here we assess an
      array of modern air pollution exposure estimation approaches for assigning
      within-city exposure estimates in Beijing for individual pollutants and pollutant
      sources to individual members of a cohort. Issues considered in selecting
      specific monitoring data or new monitoring campaigns include: needed spatial
      resolution, exposure measurement error and its impact on health effect estimates,
      spatial alignment and compatibility with the cohort, and feasibility and expense.
      Sources of existing data largely include administrative monitoring data,
      predictions from air dispersion or chemical transport models and remote sensing
      (specifically satellite) data. New air monitoring campaigns include additional
      fixed site monitoring, snapshot monitoring, passive badge or micro-sensor
      saturation monitoring and mobile monitoring, as well as combinations of these.
      Each of these has relative advantages and disadvantages. It is concluded that a
      campaign in Beijing that at least includes a mobile monitoring component, when
      coupled with currently available spatio-temporal modeling methods, should be
      strongly considered. Such a campaign is economical and capable of providing the
      desired fine-scale spatial resolution for pollutants and sources.

TI  - Assessing the Potential of Land Use Modification to Mitigate Ambient NO2 and Its 
      Consequences for Respiratory Health.
LID - 750
AB  - Understanding how local land use and land cover (LULC) shapes intra-urban
      concentrations of atmospheric pollutants—and thus human health—is a key component
      in designing healthier cities. Here, NO2 is modeled based on spatially dense
      summer and winter NO2 observations in Portland-Hillsboro-Vancouver (USA), and the
      spatial variation of NO2 with LULC investigated using random forest, an ensemble 
      data learning technique. The NO2 random forest model, together with BenMAP, is
      further used to develop a better understanding of the relationship among LULC,
      ambient NO2 and respiratory health. The impact of land use modifications on
      ambient NO2, and consequently on respiratory health, is also investigated using a
      sensitivity analysis. We find that NO2 associated with roadways and tree-canopied
      areas may be affecting annual incidence rates of asthma exacerbation in 4–12 year
      olds by +3000 per 100,000 and −1400 per 100,000, respectively. Our model shows
      that increasing local tree canopy by 5% may reduce local incidences rates of
      asthma exacerbation by 6%, indicating that targeted local tree-planting efforts
      may have a substantial impact on reducing city-wide incidence of respiratory
      distress. Our findings demonstrate the utility of random forest modeling in
      evaluating LULC modifications for enhanced respiratory health.

TI  - Particulate matter and heavy metal deposition on the leaves of Euonymus japonicus
      during the East Asian monsoon in Beijing, China.
LID - e0179840
AB  - Plants can be effectively used as bio-monitors of environmental pollution.
      However, how the particulate matter (PM) and heavy metal retention ability of
      plants changes in different areas with human disturbance along with monsoon has
      not yet been investigated in urban ecosystems. In this study, we measured the
      amount of PM and heavy metals such as Ni, Cr, Cu, Pb, and Zn accumulated by the
      leaves of Euonymus japonicus during the East Asian monsoon from different
      functional units in Beijing, China. A rinse-and-weigh method developed in our
      laboratory was used to determine the mass of the PM, and electro-thermal atomic
      absorption spectrometry was used for heavy metal analysis. We found that the
      types of functional units had little influence, whereas the monsoon had a
      significant effect on the deposition of PM: northwest areas during the monsoon
      had the lowest effect (with 0.005, 0.453, 0.643, and 1.569 g/m2 fine, coarse,
      large, and total PM, respectively), and the southeast areas during the monsoon
      had the highest effect (0.015, 2.687, 1.941, and 4.228 g/m2 for fine, coarse,
      large, and total PM, respectively). Notable, we found considerable variations in 
      heavy metal accumulation across the functional units analyzed, that is, the
      accumulation level was higher in communities than in parks (P < 0.0001 for all
      heavy metals). Moreover, a positive relationship was found between PM retention
      and heavy metal accumulation by the leaves of E. japonicus. Taken together, our
      results suggested that the PM and heavy metal retention ability of E. japonicus
      was sensitive to human disturbance and monsoon in Beijing. Since E. japonicus is 
      a widely distributed tree and has the ability of to purify the atmosphere, it is 
      an ideal plant for mitigating urban environmental pollution.

TI  - Particulate Air Pollution from Wildfires in the Western US under Climate Change.
PG  - 655-66
AB  - Wildfire can impose a direct impact on human health under climate change. While
      the potential impacts of climate change on wildfires and resulting air pollution 
      have been studied, it is not known who will be most affected by the growing
      threat of wildfires. Identifying communities that will be most affected will
      inform development of fire management strategies and disaster preparedness
      programs. We estimate levels of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) directly
      attributable to wildfires in 561 western US counties during fire seasons for the 
      present-day (2004-2009) and future (2046-2051), using a fire prediction model and
      GEOS-Chem, a 3-D global chemical transport model. Future estimates are obtained
      under a scenario of moderately increasing greenhouse gases by mid-century. We
      create a new term “Smoke Wave,” defined as ≥2 consecutive days with high
      wildfire-specific PM2.5, to describe episodes of high air pollution from
      wildfires. We develop an interactive map to demonstrate the counties likely to
      suffer from future high wildfire pollution events. For 2004-2009, on days
      exceeding regulatory PM2.5 standards, wildfires contributed an average of 71.3%
      of total PM2.5. Under future climate change, we estimate that more than 82
      million individuals will experience a 57% and 31% increase in the frequency and
      intensity, respectively, of Smoke Waves. Northern California, Western Oregon and 
      the Great Plains are likely to suffer the highest exposure to widlfire smoke in
      the future. Results point to the potential health impacts of increasing wildfire 
      activity on large numbers of people in a warming climate and the need to
      establish or modify US wildfire management and evacuation programs in high-risk
      regions. The study also adds to the growing literature arguing that extreme
      events in a changing climate could have significant consequences for human
      health.

TI  - Compliance with the proper use of an individual radiation dosimeter among
      children and the effects of improper use on the measured dose: a retrospective
      study 18–20 months following Japan's 2011 Fukushima nuclear incident.
LID - e009555
AB  - Objectives: To identify profiles of children who did not properly use individual 
      radiation dosimeters following Japan's 2011 Fukushima nuclear incident, and to
      assess how much error is generated by improper dosimeter use. Participants: The
      participants in this study comprised 1637 school children who participated in the
      external radiation exposure screening programme administrated by Minamisoma City 
      (located 20–30 km from the Fukushima nuclear plant) between 18 and 20 months
      after the Fukushima incident. Methods: We assessed the factors associated with
      improper use (non-use) of the dosimeters at specific time periods during the day 
      (school commuting hours, at school, at home, outdoors and at bedtime) using
      logistic regression analyses. Ratios of the measured dose to regression estimates
      of the ‘expected’ dose (referred to as an error due to non-use) were also
      examined. Results: Only 119 children (7.3%) used the dosimeters properly in all
      time periods. This low rate was attributed primarily to non-use when children
      were in the home and outdoors, rather than at school. School level, air dose rate
      at home, gender, membership in outdoor sports clubs and time spent outdoors on
      weekends, were significantly associated with improper use, after adjustment for
      covariates. Data from children who did not wear the dosimeters to school and
      outdoors had statistically significant (but clinically insignificant) errors
      (ratio: 1.13, p<0.01; and 0.97, p<0.05, respectively), whereas improper use of
      the dosimeters at school, at home and at bedtime did not generate significant
      errors. Conclusions: Well-targeted rigorous instructions on the use of the
      dosimeter are required, with particular focus on time periods other than school
      hours. However, given the small dose error due to the improper use of the
      dosimeters, even if the dosimeters are improperly used, solid evaluation of the
      radiation exposure may be possible with some accuracy.

TI  - Current Methods and Challenges for Epidemiological Studies of the Associations
      Between Chemical Constituents of Particulate Matter and Health.
PG  - 388-98
AB  - Epidemiological studies have been critical for estimating associations between
      exposure to ambient particulate matter (PM) air pollution and adverse health
      outcomes. Because total PM mass is a temporally and spatially varying mixture of 
      constituents with different physical and chemical properties, recent
      epidemiological studies have focused on PM constituents. Most studies have
      estimated associations between PM constituents and health using the same
      statistical methods as in studies of PM mass. However, these approaches may not
      be sufficient to address challenges specific to studies of PM constituents,
      namely assigning exposure, disentangling health effects, and handling measurement
      error. We reviewed large, population-based epidemiological studies of PM
      constituents and health and describe the statistical methods typically applied to
      address these challenges. Development of statistical methods that simultaneously 
      address multiple challenges, for example, both disentangling health effects and
      handling measurement error, could improve estimation of associations between PM
      constituents and adverse health outcomes.

TI  - Effects of Urban Landscape Pattern on PM2.5 Pollution—A Beijing Case Study.
LID - e0142449
AB  - PM2.5 refers to particulate matter (PM) in air that is less than 2.5μm in
      aerodynamic diameter, which has negative effects on air quality and human health.
      PM2.5 is the main pollutant source in haze occurring in Beijing, and it also has 
      caused many problems in other cities. Previous studies have focused mostly on the
      relationship between land use and air quality, but less research has specifically
      explored the effects of urban landscape patterns on PM2.5. This study considered 
      the rapidly growing and heavily polluted Beijing, China. To better understand the
      impact of urban landscape pattern on PM2.5 pollution, five landscape metrics
      including PLAND, PD, ED, SHEI, and CONTAG were applied in the study. Further,
      other data, such as street networks, population density, and elevation considered
      as factors influencing PM2.5, were obtained through RS and GIS. By means of
      correlation analysis and stepwise multiple regression, the effects of landscape
      pattern on PM2.5 concentration was explored. The results showed that (1) at
      class-level, vegetation and water were significant landscape components in
      reducing PM2.5 concentration, while cropland played a special role in PM2.5
      concentration; (2) landscape configuration (ED and PD) features at class-level
      had obvious effects on particulate matter; and (3) at the landscape-level, the
      evenness (SHEI) and fragmentation (CONTAG) of the whole landscape related closely
      with PM2.5 concentration. Results of this study could expand our understanding of
      the role of urban landscape pattern on PM2.5 and provide useful information for
      urban planning.

TI  - Development of Long-term Spatiotemporal Models for Ambient Ozone in Six
      Metropolitan regions of the United States: The MESA Air Study.
PG  - 79-87
AB  - Background: Current epidemiologic studies rely on simple ozone metrics which may 
      not appropriately capture population ozone exposure. For understanding health
      effects of long-term ozone exposure in population studies, it is advantageous for
      exposure estimation to incorporate the complex spatiotemporal pattern of ozone
      concentrations at fine scales. Objective: To develop a geo-statistical exposure
      prediction model that predicts fine scale spatiotemporal variations of ambient
      ozone in six United States metropolitan regions. Methods: We developed a modeling
      framework that estimates temporal trends from regulatory agency and
      cohort-specific monitoring data from MESA Air measurement campaigns and
      incorporates land use regression with universal kriging using predictor variables
      from a large geographic database. The cohort-specific data were measured at home 
      and community locations. The framework was applied in estimating two-week average
      ozone concentrations from 1999 to 2013 in models of each of the six MESA Air
      metropolitan regions. Results: Ozone models perform well in both spatial and
      temporal dimensions at the agency monitoring sites in terms of prediction
      accuracy. City-specific leave-one (site)-out cross-validation R2 accounting for
      temporal and spatial variability ranged from 0.65 to 0.88 in the six regions. For
      predictions at the home sites, the R2 is between 0.60 and 0.91 for
      cross-validation that left out 10% of home sites in turn. The predicted ozone
      concentrations vary substantially over space and time in all the metropolitan
      regions. Conclusion: Using the available data, our spatiotemporal models are able
      to accurately predict long-term ozone concentrations at fine spatial scales in
      multiple regions. The model predictions will allow for investigation of the
      long-term health effects of ambient ozone concentrations in future
      epidemiological studies.

TI  - Temporal and Spatial Simulation of Atmospheric Pollutant PM2.5 Changes and Risk
      Assessment of Population Exposure to Pollution Using Optimization Algorithms of
      the Back Propagation-Artificial Neural Network Model and GIS.
PG  - 12171-95
AB  - PM2.5 pollution has become of increasing public concern because of its relative
      importance and sensitivity to population health risks. Accurate predictions of
      PM2.5 pollution and population exposure risks are crucial to developing effective
      air pollution control strategies. We simulated and predicted the temporal and
      spatial changes of PM2.5 concentration and population exposure risks, by coupling
      optimization algorithms of the Back Propagation-Artificial Neural Network
      (BP-ANN) model and a geographical information system (GIS) in Xi’an, China, for
      2013, 2020, and 2025. Results indicated that PM2.5 concentration was positively
      correlated with GDP, SO2, and NO2, while it was negatively correlated with
      population density, average temperature, precipitation, and wind speed. Principal
      component analysis of the PM2.5 concentration and its influencing factors’
      variables extracted four components that accounted for 86.39% of the total
      variance. Correlation coefficients of the Levenberg-Marquardt (trainlm) and
      elastic (trainrp) algorithms were more than 0.8, the index of agreement (IA)
      ranged from 0.541 to 0.863 and from 0.502 to 0.803 by trainrp and trainlm
      algorithms, respectively; mean bias error (MBE) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)
      indicated that the predicted values were very close to the observed values, and
      the accuracy of trainlm algorithm was better than the trainrp. Compared to 2013, 
      temporal and spatial variation of PM2.5 concentration and risk of population
      exposure to pollution decreased in 2020 and 2025. The high-risk areas of
      population exposure to PM2.5 were mainly distributed in the northern region,
      where there is downtown traffic, abundant commercial activity, and more exhaust
      emissions. A moderate risk zone was located in the southern region associated
      with some industrial pollution sources, and there were mainly low-risk areas in
      the western and eastern regions, which are predominantly residential and
      educational areas.

TI  - An Approach to Improve the Performance of PM Forecasters.
LID - e0138507
AB  - The particulate matter (PM) concentration has been one of the most relevant
      environmental concerns in recent decades due to its prejudicial effects on living
      beings and the earth’s atmosphere. High PM concentration affects the human health
      in several ways leading to short and long term diseases. Thus, forecasting
      systems have been developed to support decisions of the organizations and
      governments to alert the population. Forecasting systems based on Artificial
      Neural Networks (ANNs) have been highlighted in the literature due to their
      performances. In general, three ANN-based approaches have been found for this
      task: ANN trained via learning algorithms, hybrid systems that combine search
      algorithms with ANNs, and hybrid systems that combine ANN with other forecasters.
      Independent of the approach, it is common to suppose that the residuals (error
      series), obtained from the difference between actual series and forecasting, have
      a white noise behavior. However, it is possible that this assumption is infringed
      due to: misspecification of the forecasting model, complexity of the time series 
      or temporal patterns of the phenomenon not captured by the forecaster. This paper
      proposes an approach to improve the performance of PM forecasters from residuals 
      modeling. The approach analyzes the remaining residuals recursively in search of 
      temporal patterns. At each iteration, if there are temporal patterns in the
      residuals, the approach generates the forecasting of the residuals in order to
      improve the forecasting of the PM time series. The proposed approach can be used 
      with either only one forecaster or by combining two or more forecasting models.
      In this study, the approach is used to improve the performance of a hybrid system
      (HS) composed by genetic algorithm (GA) and ANN from residuals modeling performed
      by two methods, namely, ANN and own hybrid system. Experiments were performed for
      PM2.5 and PM10 concentration series in Kallio and Vallila stations in Helsinki
      and evaluated from six metrics. Experimental results show that the proposed
      approach improves the accuracy of the forecasting method in terms of fitness
      function for all cases, when compared with the method without correction. The
      correction via HS obtained a superior performance, reaching the best results in
      terms of fitness function and in five out of six metrics. These results also were
      found when a sensitivity analysis was performed varying the proportions of the
      sets of training, validation and test. The proposed approach reached consistent
      results when compared with the forecasting method without correction, showing
      that it can be an interesting tool for correction of PM forecasters.

TI  - Acute effect of fine particulate matter on mortality in three southeastern states
      2007–2011.
PG  - 173-9
AB  - Epidemiologic studies on acute effects of air pollution have generally been
      limited to larger cities, leaving questions about rural populations
      behind.Recently, we had developed a spatiotemporal model to predict daily PM2.5
      level at a 1 km2 using satellite aerosol optical depth data. Based on the results
      from the model, we applied a case-crossover study to evaluate the acute effect of
      PM2.5 on mortality in North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia between 2007
      and 2011.Mortality data were acquired from the departments of public health in
      the states and modeled PM2.5 exposures were assigned to the zip code of residence
      of each decedent. We performed various stratified analyses by age, sex, race,
      education, cause of death, residence, and EPA standards. We also compared results
      of analyses using our modeled PM2.5 levels and those imputed daily from the
      nearest monitoring station.848,270 non-accidental death records were analyzed and
      we found each 10 μg/m3 increase in PM2.5 (mean lag0 and lag1) was associated with
      a 1.56% (1.19, 1.94) increase in daily deaths. Cardiovascular disease (2.32%,
      1.57–3.07) showed the highest effect estimate. Blacks (2.19%, 1.43–2.96) and
      persons with education ≤8 yr (3.13%, 2.08–4.19) were the most vulnerable
      populations. The effect of PM2.5 on mortality still exists in zip code areas that
      meet the PM2.5 EPA annual standard (2.06%, 1.97–2.15). The effect of PM2.5 below 
      both EPA daily and annual standards was 2.08% (95% CI = 1.99 to 2.17). Our
      results showed more power and suggested that the PM2.5 effects on rural
      populations have been underestimated due to selection bias and information
      bias.We have demonstrated that our AOD-based exposure models can be successfully 
      applied to epidemiologic studies. This will add new study populations in rural
      areas, and will confer more generalizability to conclusions from such studies.

TI  - Estimation of Populations Exposed to Road Traffic Noise in Districts of Seoul
      Metropolitan Area of Korea.
PG  - 2729-40
AB  - This study aims to model road traffic noise levels and estimate the human
      exposure at the 25 districts in the metropolitan Seoul, Republic of Korea. The
      SoundPLAN® Version 7.1 software package was used to model noise levels and
      simulated road traffic noise maps were created. The people exposed to
      daytime/nighttime road traffic noise were also estimated. The proportions of the 
      population exposed to road traffic noise in major cities in the EU were also
      estimated and compared. Eight (8) districts show the exceeded rate (percentage of
      the exposed population exceeding the daytime standard) of 20% or more, and eleven
      (11) districts show 10%-20% and six (6) districts show less than 10%, which
      indicates considerable variation among districts. Two districts (Nowon-gu and
      Yangcheon-gu) show the highest exposure rate during the daytime (35.2%). For
      nighttime noise levels, fourteen (14) districts show the exceeded rate
      (percentage of exposed population exceeding the nighttime standard) over 30%. The
      average percentages of the exposed population exceeding the daytime/nighttime
      standards in Seoul and the EU were 16.6%/34.8% and 13.0%/16.1%, respectively. The
      results show that road traffic noise reduction measures should urgently be taken 
      for the nighttime traffic noise in Seoul. When the grid noise map and the 3-D
      façade noise map were compared, the 3-D façade noise map was more accurate in
      estimating exposed population in citywide noise mapping.

TI  - Quantifying the health impacts of air pollution under a changing climate—a review
      of approaches and methodology.
PG  - 149-60
AB  - Climate change has been predicted to affect future air quality, with inevitable
      consequences for health. Quantifying the health effects of air pollution under a 
      changing climate is crucial to provide evidence for actions to safeguard future
      populations. In this paper, we review published methods for quantifying health
      impacts to identify optimal approaches and ways in which existing challenges
      facing this line of research can be addressed. Most studies have employed a
      simplified methodology, while only a few have reported sensitivity analyses to
      assess sources of uncertainty. The limited investigations that do exist suggest
      that examining the health risk estimates should particularly take into account
      the uncertainty associated with future air pollution emissions scenarios,
      concentration-response functions, and future population growth and age
      structures. Knowledge gaps identified for future research include future health
      impacts from extreme air pollution events, interactions between temperature and
      air pollution effects on public health under a changing climate, and how
      population adaptation and behavioural changes in a warmer climate may modify
      exposure to air pollution and health consequences.Electronic supplementary

TI  - Interactions of Physical, Chemical, and Biological Weather Calling for an
      Integrated Approach to Assessment, Forecasting, and Communication of Air Quality.
PG  - 851-64
AB  - This article reviews interactions and health impacts of physical, chemical, and
      biological weather. Interactions and synergistic effects between the three types 
      of weather call for integrated assessment, forecasting, and communication of air 
      quality. Today’s air quality legislation falls short of addressing air quality
      degradation by biological weather, despite increasing evidence for the
      feasibility of both mitigation and adaptation policy options. In comparison with 
      the existing capabilities for physical and chemical weather, the monitoring of
      biological weather is lacking stable operational agreements and resources.
      Furthermore, integrated effects of physical, chemical, and biological weather
      suggest a critical review of air quality management practices. Additional
      research is required to improve the coupled modeling of physical, chemical, and
      biological weather as well as the assessment and communication of integrated air 
      quality. Findings from several recent COST Actions underline the importance of an
      increased dialog between scientists from the fields of meteorology, air quality, 
      aerobiology, health, and policy makers.
